  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 26 April 18th 2018

  
 our first news item this week is around the ongoing work to support webassembly a little bit better why isn't packed as a tool that makes it easier to compile rust webassembly and then ship that over to mpm this makes it one stop shopping for any JavaScript developer that wants to use your crate can use your m p m package with all the same functionality lots of really cool stuff happening in a rusted webassembly space with Wisin pack this week joining wasn't buying gin and a few other tools were really starting to see that whole tool chain flush out I feel excited to see what everyone is going to do with this thing of course link to the blog post so you can read more

  
 I mentioned it a few times that Cindy was marching it's inevitable way the word stabilization on happy to report that it actually has been stabilized so the pr has landed and it's expected to ship as part of 1.27 so that's in a couple of releases this means that for the first time staple crates will be able to depend on Cindy features and get all the benefits and optimization that they enable so that might mean that just by updating your crate dependencies your own code may start to go faster which is pretty awesome our next bit of news is actually in three parts talking about what's new in ID is this week the 1st but if I D E news is around intelligence plug-in so the IntelliJ Russ plugin has been steadily updating and steadily increasing its capabilities this most recent update Lance better support for Russ macros so expect to see even better completions going forward or second but if I D news is a fun one you may not have known but vs code has been working with the R Us team 10

  
 but I knew better functionality for rust users rest areas tend to be these nice visual errors that have multiple underlines sound showing what's going wrong in the program and then other showing how that might have happened in the bit of extra information how to use traditionally only give you one underline but none of the secondary ones that he has code team has been working with the R Us team to come up with a solution to this so in the most recent vs code releases you'll see that additional bit of information in the Highlight I'll go ahead and link to what they've got working already and our final bit of I D E news we talked about cargo Source this is a new plug into cargo its focus is on standing up in your web browser away to explore your source code there's a lot of potential for a to like this that's easier than just text searching for your code it's still very much a work-in-progress as Nick Cameron points out I'll go ahead and link to the blog post in the description

  
 RX reduces for those curious about the ongoing work to support kinoman rust they just started their third pack fast that's right there third hackfest I'll link to the report from the first day of this third hackfest some of the work that they're doing this week is Smoothie the interaction between rust and the fundamental libraries could know our next news item is a bit of a request for the rest of Oprah tools team I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the rust Funk tool that's the rest formatting tool that format your source code in a very standard layout of restaurant is hoping to hit Pompano sometime in the next 6 to 10 weeks and one of the ways to help it get there I'll be to try it out test it and give your feedback Nick Cameron who heads up the rest of Albert tools team has asked me to reach out to the listeners for volunteers to try out rust spots on your code if there's anything that doesn't look quite right or in any way restaurant doesn't do what it seems like it should file an issue

  
 reach out to the team let them know this will help the 1.0 release be that much better and last but not least you may know of redox haha Vos created with rust but did you know that they're toasting their own summer of code this year that's right from their own volunteer efforts they've self-funded enough to host about three students and their own summer of code a link to more information about that summer of code if you're a student listening this and you're interested I definitely encourage you to apply

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and as always keep on resting
