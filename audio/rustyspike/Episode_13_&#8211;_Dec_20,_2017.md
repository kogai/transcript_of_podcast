  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 13 December 20th 2017

  
 our first news on this week is a pretty cool hack if you've done any compile to JavaScript languages you may have seen the use of source Maps before Source maps are way of mapping from the original Source language down to JavaScript and many if not all browser is currently support Source Maps is a way to handle the bugging so that when you're dividing the code you see the original source code recently it was showing off a r us to webassembly use of source Maps which means it in a browser you'll be able to open the door bugger and then as you're stepping in your to bug her you'll actually see the original Russ code now still very early on but it's pretty cool to see that already working our next news item is rather curious if you've been watching the Google get her really closely you've noticed that they've added every once in awhile and new R Us tool some I noticed recently that a new tool was released called re rast rear ass is a tool for doing Roscoe Transformations basically

  
 you can run the tool and then tell it what transformation to do on your dress code and it will do it and I think it's really cool that we see companies like Google actually experimenting dipping their Towing and playing with rust that we know they thought it some in the past and they're continuing to do so and I find that really encouraging

  
 Carl you webassembly found out there there's one more item this week on webassembly and this is super cool as you may know Russ has the standard library in the standard library has basic capabilities for systems-level things like opening files and handles and whatnot someone is currently working on a new standard library for Russ called standard web and as you can imagine standard web is the standard library but geared up for doing web development app has been there for a while but recently added support for wasm 32 - unknown I known aka the new Wes I'm support that's much more concise this is if you will a nice compliment to the wasm support that Alex recently added now this new capability allows you to access the Dom and Colin to JavaScript from your dress code so it's pretty cool

  
 if you've been following the ergonomics initiative and non lexical lifetime switch readmission on the podcast before you'll notice that the nautical lifetime work which is a way to improve the power Checker and the bar checking errors so that's much more precise please pull request to Implanon Mexico lifetimes have been stage one at a time to handle more and more of the case it's a pretty big effort to get my lights on life X & R Us as you can imagine I'm happy to report that this week in fact just hours ago the last of these nomics old-time polar Quest was posted so they can be reviewed this all told is the whole story for Knoxville lifetimes of course it's not yet in the compiler says his jumping the gun a little bit but I'm really excited to see all of these namakkal lifetime pork Westland and for people to really start playing with it and giving feedback

  
 I've got one more news item and this one is for you Tokyo fans out there so someone has written an article called Tokyo internals understanding rust asynchronous IO framework from the bottom up this gives you a deep dive and understanding how Tokyo works I know for a lot of people Tokyo can be a bit complicated there's a lot going on it's trying very hard to be really efficient and it's important that you understand is Concepts and this article is a great way with lots of visualization to see how Tokyo works there's some links actually at the bottom of the article to if you want to see more from one of the co-creators of Tokyo one bit of bookkeeping news this is will be the last podcast episode for this year who got the holidays coming up and I personally will be moving as well soon so we'll have to take a little bit of a break but will catch back up at the beginning of next year I'm sure you're like me and just as helpful just as excited about what next year will be

  
 I'm looking forward to doing more reporting once we get there and that's it for this week as always thanks for listening and keep on resting
