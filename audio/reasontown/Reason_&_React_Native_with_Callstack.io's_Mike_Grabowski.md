  
hello and welcome to another episode of Reason town I'm Jared Forsyth and I'm here with Mike Grabowski from call Zach IL welcome Mike hello and thanks for having me today thanks for being on the show we this this is been several months in the making today we're going to talk about react-native and reason and things that they're doing a Cossack but first I want to thank our bed with sponsor Tyler McGinnis. Com always grateful and Tyler has a lot of really great resources for leveling up your JavaScript framework game so Mike does the first question I want to ask you is how did you get involved in recent and what initially attracted you to it all right so this is kind of interesting story. I think you know Elias pretty well with the ideas behind reason itself so I started kind of recently after you know doing

  
Baton Rouge a busted for a while and so I just started reaching out into reason for you know the type safety and the sword of better syntax that was kind of a refreshing to me and I also reliably functional sort of way of writing apps with reason so I kind of started experimenting with. Just to see you know what are the benefits that I could get out of using it and also I just like learning new languages and for many years I had this problem with learning oh, I had it at the University but I was so bad at it I don't know why I just couldn't get an idea how to write programs with it I remember I had to write a bubble sort algorithm you know, and those just so hard for me to do it so that I actually Started Loving reason I've realized that I that I finally understand that and I and I could you notify riding oh, right now as well so I think it was partially to find that I always wanted to reach into that ecosystem is just that it was kind of hard for me before

  
and also because you know there were so many great things happening in the reason Community mainly you know reason reason reactive elements that have heard about all the philosophies behind that and the fact that I heard we can react react should have been from the beginning I tried to be nice to actually give it a go and see you in a world of the hyperbole about and whether it's something that I could you know get a benefits at my day job as well cool and and how is it lived up to the hype yeah I mean I mean when people are just you know Sangre zombies great for the marketing I feel like everything that people been saying about the reason we're actually right I just I just wish it was more popular because that it would be much easier sexually gattina real work and that wasn't trying to get some for the past few months

  
clients generally are sort of afraid of finding out developers there are you don't have to learn reason and essentially creating apps for that you know there's just so many great things about reason tomorrow

  
 did I wish it was more popular because. That way we could all benefit from all the great type safety and ffi between reason and drive us to death could make our ecosystem much better there is there a lot of benefits that come with a larger community that are kind of not entirely connected to the demerits of the language itself but that really helped said about a process

  
 so the next question let's get this out of the way what it what are your biggest pain points with reason other than other than Community not being as hard as you like any question I mean it's not really a pain point but it's something that I'm struggling with the the library's I mean for me it's kind of fun by I mean I I I kind of like that it's only because I hurt your episode on doing that and that's what helped me understand the concept of few no writing all the things between Arisen among JavaScript libraries that I see the helpers are having or as it's more like they are just afraid of not being able to find a library. They will need to ride tonight they will need to use and so you know sometimes there might be just not enough time to actually

  
 how to actually go and Anna Queen such such findings so in that context I think you know it's it's it's sort of the biggest problem other than that I mean I kind of don't feel like there are too many people and so I can like with the things that I like the most to maybe turn this question to what are the favorites is Aaliyah is definitely you know the fact that it's just that it has such a great in syrup with JavaScript I just to give you an example I've been working on navigation library and I was just about to ride bindings to JavaScript library and I had to pass a reasonable of Ariana to JavaScript and I would probably get it back and my biggest my biggest worry was like how this Vine is going to get past in between JavaScript be just as essentially reason to mail construction so I had no idea how this going to work but then I realized

  
 and at any stop Ali sort of Transport for JavaScript was Easter activities is going to play around with so it's it's like I was surprised to have it working out of the box without any major issues still up. You know Dieter be so great that it actually makes it very easy to write five safe libraries in the Malco that sometimes have to talk with JavaScript without writing a lot of magic powers. Encode and decode stinks at Central and the other sort of slowly looking into the bilge system I know there is so many greatest cash is happening right now about the bill system this is also sorry that I'm exploring in context of reactivate even how do you how how we handle you know first Barbie Mojo's that contain a z code so I really kind of like the fact that business so this is you know given a lot of Corrections from the reason the mill community and that there is just so much

  
 great things happening there such as just recently I've realized there is going to be a feature called virtual modules which allows you to create a module that implementation provided by another module so think that you are creating a variegated library or a cross-platform library for a rendering you're awesome and so we can just create a place for the like an interface and Ferb party mode juul can dynamically providing limitation for the interface so we can just install another package that will allow your main package surrender your code to bring up light West so that's kind of interesting also from the cross-platform perspective very cool we're touching on some of the exciting things and react native but before we get there can you give us a little background on your experience with react native and call Zack

  
 yep so I might react native story starts when I was creating I only got some Bangalore that was many years ago I think many of us remembered about just for you know those who who started do you know Provident development kind of recently before react and when I was starving gross to either go fully or to use web you like solution where you will essentially drop a weapon inside your app and render HTML code some sort of a webpage that looks on and Fades the behavior of the mobile app so so I was playing around with that and I remember one day when I move to London there was a way you know just interrupt me when I'm going to leaping through you know the story

  
 I mean now this is changing past few years ago with in history be always sort of a bit behind you as far as the cology like we are not at early adopters giving you know the market and we are working on so long that it was probably a bit of pressure for me because I had to write a mobile app and I was given time to do a proper research how can I do that and since I had no knowledge about writing mobile apps on Android I had a little olidge how to write apps on iOS objective-c I started researching the opportunities of writing cross-platform apps and it was just the right time to react native got an ounce then I was like wow I like a concept I like that beat idea I know it would have reacted so I immediately just downloaded the Alpha version I convince my boss and the production of this app and that's how my right knee deep cervix. Started well

  
 I was also out of the developers in that Community to start over start taking active part of the open-source life because I was given time for my employee and play or so to maintain the apps so yeah that's that's how I met you know I sort of got to spend almost past 4 years and are working on various bits and pieces and then you know when I get there when I get sort of from. 3 Quest how we could like what I started as a full-time after I also started working releases helping the community on Facebook p.m. to sort of ethereum ATM growing me helping them out as far as you know building apps or maybe soaking some Bach faces and sister are just too much request for me to handle at a time I felt like wow this might be a great idea

  
 company and that's how I go stock idea was created to essentially establish up spread the word after this day you know sitting in be crushed by from space writing mobile apps and that's the routes were clients and basically helping them migrated from a mouthful called basis to a single cab base is the reason why I'm here obviously it's one of the best Technologies right now in the market to do so and that's why we are exploring remedies and unreasonable and an endocrinologist like that we use

  
 react native extensively and we are very grateful for all of the open-source work that y'all do to help with documenting the changelog and helping with reactive releases we very much appreciate it thank you thank you very much given the Academy shoes it's like a nice case study that one could do by just waiting for the react native you know you shoes that's right that's right yeah so tell us about BS react-native and react native from reason and what's coming up

  
 shirt so awesome history so when we started looking into reasonable obviously you know how we can ride to reason the mail apps apps was the first question... Came out during our discussions we started looking at you know around the the solutions that we found out that there is BS we have maintained by one of my friends from Poland to which was a very very surprising and exciting at the same time thing for me

  
 and so and so yeah we started so we started looking to the project and we started contributing to it trying to make it more customers developer-friendly to have more patience will be easier to I'm bored cuz there is that notion that you know all the BS libraries indeed have are very very cryptic like you open them up and sometimes you have no idea how to get started so we wanted to change that and it make it super-easy so we've been working on that quite heavily I called that the view on version of PS3 quite heavily on that and to make sure that we could buy names to all the components do all the apis and that everything works as smoothly as possible and that you can get started kind of easy so just been down by the community and was how both and I think we are actually create

  
 reasonable without major issues and problems so the V1 version is sort of dumb

  
 we are switching to maintenance mode and I'm sort of looking into the future which is you know de vita version or the V free version we have this out of Play-Doh versions that we are using I prefer to a different concept but we are prototyping with being so that's as far as current stage of the other thing is navigation which is crucial thing for every mobile app and also something that it's not as far as toys in the mail and the ladies will be working on we are we are working on the right now on the library that will allow me to navigate to Route your reasonable apps and this is perfect example of what I can always saying that are creating reason the metal bindings to JavaScript library gives you the perfect opportunity

  
 to reflect on the API and do you prove it in some places that way you can sort of get rid of all that JavaScript the things that you have you know that affect the API and this is pretty exciting like like for example react-navigation if you are familiar with that has started Consecration and requires the use of classes for example and also has many different ways of setting up configuration for a route it's it's kind of his kind of flexible it's easy by the same time you know you can get lost out of Easley do too many options right example with reason that we are not just made me making bindings to it we are sort of its a rating on the interface trying to trying to make this interface more reasonable than Java scripts are we using a lot of variance

  
 typing everything from the ground up and this gives us a lot of great benefits that you can get with low tide for example far as I know such as when you have an obligate fraction that shoot that that is supposed to be basically navigation to a different route we can have this fully typed as far as like we won't let you navigate to Route that doesn't exist or to ride the pass at every price per ounce and you know and you do not provide that so I'm sort of solving a lot of pain points that that we had as far as creating navigations with react native and safe so that you know you can't make a lot of mistakes such as

  
 you know there is the EDD animated value that you can interpolate and you know after after interpolate animated value that if human patients S as a result you receive any major problem is these are not the same animated values I mean that the parent classes the same but they are essentially different and wants to interpolate animated value you can't pass that value to any makes it towed to a fraction like timing door spring function so it can give you a lot of cryptic errors in the mail we can't type. So we sort of difference between them if this sounds like totally crazy for her for anyone listening so you don't have to spend time thinking like why I'm getting this error wearing socks we are just doing animation value operations which obviously should be allowed

  
 yeah kind of helping you know I've always pretty silly mistakes I when you're just starting out found when when reading bindings for JavaScript libraries there often a lot of opportunities to to make the API make more sense just because reason has more tools more types for describing data

  
 yeah yeah totally I totally agree with that what's what's what's more when I was writing typings to libraries. Already hate hats types for example there was like three types with a slow typer type script I've realized there places that are look typed and nobody knows about them so there is to know about raising the model type system that makes it much more comfortable and convenient for you to write your apps and and anybody you know these sort of issue that I just talked about are not handled so there is a tiny difference between these two languages as far as types typescript inflow they still have some holes they're trying to be more closer to Dallas with Funtime whereas reason we got sucked clean slate

  
 by the way so that's that's a little bit about the the past of BS react native and Bs react navigation you do you give us a hint just a little bit ago about Native compiled reason modules with react native what's what's the future there

  
 yeah so so that's that's pretty much the reason why it why I got so so excited about the reason I'm out I mean you know very very strong push towards cross-platform compilation that you immediately feel when you get to reasonable community and I love that everybody talks about that it's not a second-class citizen it's just up everybody thinks about that and as exciting so so the future the future I said that we just finished did the V1 version of BS react native I'm not sure if it's released as a view on but that's how we call it internally and that we are trying to get into that involve some in an in-between steps so the ideal scenario that we've been prototyping is to have

  
 a browser Lite API that we will allow us to essentially render any language that we that we would like to use on the front end to mobile Weber other platforms and we are trying to get there from many many middle steps to basically get the community with us and provide a gradual path for them to operate as well so so what we are trying to do right now which is also not up hints that I was given on Twitter is that we are trying to make sure he's in the mower talk with react native over the bridge rather than JavaScript so instead of writing by Innings we trying to use who's in the mo on the front end and whatever it is right now on the back on the back and some of the negative side and wants that gets working we will be trying to essentially skip the bridge so make reason the mail rather natively in the places where you

  
 so many people that are you know prototyping cross-platform Solutions right now they are thinking that we should drop JavaScript because that's the that's that that's the problem actually think it's an opportunity because thanks to JavaScript running there in the browser contacts we get so many great libraries benefits an ecosystem and dropping that I just for the performance entirely you know what sort of food as compared with libraries like shimmering I guess so I think that having this as a future not as a requirement such as you can choose what parts should be native and what parts can be in JavaScript or maybe we'll we'll parts of your components can be right reason that way is a very exciting opportunity the reason the reason that we sort of have stopped I mean we've been struggling to progress in their interest in the past weeks mainly because of the

  
 actually rewrite or free I think that's happening with fabric

  
 and it's going to change so many friends that it's just very hard for us to do you know starved reason for that is that currently ready-made has the bridge and whatever JavaScript is calling me so it goes over the bridge and then and then it's maps to a native routine and that maybe routine is executed are you will have the ability to call native APS directly and so we started with the first approach so we started of the bridge but we are thinking right now to just go with the fabric infrastructure cuz that's that's a bit easier for us just bind to those needed me. Ripley

  
 yeah I mean I mean long story short is that reason I'm out in Oconto ecosystem form is pretty exciting ecosystem to explore it starts response from Kappa bilities and the fact I'll come O can you know Target many platforms and reasonable thanks to that as well it makes me really excited to explore these these opportunities I know we are not the only ones in the community because there are projects like brisk where we are trying to write everything from the ground up and that's totally fine it's just that we think that having to react native from

  
 compatibility I will be will be pretty handy so the goal is to get rid of the video JavaScript power to pre-pay to you because if you look at 3 if it's off it's pretty nice abstraction I mean the concept of the bridge and it's pretty nice it's pretty nice abstraction and so there is no reason to Coppell that do either react or who I was an Android it would be great to have this obstructed away so that you can use how you can use if you Jes rather Technologies bapi can be provided in any language. B wants so reason the milk would be a great language for providing that support and that's why we are looking into that

  
 okay so can you can you paint a picture for me of what you imagine it would look like you talked about having parts of a component or parts of your app in JavaScript in park or compile to JavaScript and parts of it compiled to Native what how would that work

  
 sure so so just just just one disclaimer like I'm still learning a lot about these things so I bought you know what you asked me about my old, and the reason the middle tool chain I might be struggling to answer on that it's also few folks from the community Oregon brag about I can't pronounce their handles I hope they forgive me that so I would imagine I would imagine you being able to just for example write an API in a separate file or use a reason I don't know ya like just starve a separate file like this is the native API this is a file that has that has the ability to go into native goat can use some atbp eyes it's like it's like you would probably

  
 Warcraft you know Buckle strap apis you know instead of working with the reason the mail like both Library Rebelle tried to rewrite it so it's up to you whether the two statues if you start calling JavaScript apis in this file is probably should be you know JavaScript into her by default I mean like like component for example but if you have some some code that you'd like to run natively such as I don't know back at a bi or maybe native modules that would be pretty interesting that's really that's really great about that is that for example right now requires it's right in three languages at a time if you are thinking seriously about launching via JavaScript and Dan Java coupling an Objective C or Swift

  
 so so what we could do about that is instead of writing in three languages you can ride your native modules in the same language such as pretty much similar is just that you would use different apis like when they decide you would have be able to call Javis to Baby eyes and such a bad for people for sure and yeah who knows what will be next maybe once we have both parts and reason to recruit from the glucose in the middle as well so he said we'll approach like like we are just too early from the end goal to be able to say okay this is the idea that we work out cuz it may work out so well. You know there are other pieces of react native infrastructure such as the bridge the JavaScript API that we would like to replace the right now we are at the beginning

  
 very few layer on top of JavaScript and we'd like to get rid of that first so exciting places such as dropping the whole JavaScript API and writing types of a reasonable API from the ground up maybe rewriting the bridge so it's pretty it's pretty exciting it's just that we need to be very careful because you know there is a lot of fundamental changes happening three of nativist well such as we are at the extraction for Native components inside native if you ever read an 80s modular were thinking how you can run there and made use component inside we are you are most likely going to work with a view manager at this is going to be using a totally different called an abstraction for that right so it's just very hard for us to rewrite it when we don't know where is the end of go but you know one day we will be ready to do

  
 until that happens we just keep exploring and learning how how we can actually approach that fascinating it sounds like there's a lot of exciting opportunities there if so for the people that are listening and thinking wow I really want to get involved in this what are what are places were y'all could really use some Community contributions

  
 yeah so we have created recently updated Discord server and this reason to react native Discord server is where we keep talking about anything and everything related to react native reason that mouth and they use development as well the first thing to get Stardust just sign up there I think I can send you a link after other broadcast okay and just which I'll bet you have some time but you'd like to help and that would be pretty exciting. I mean I mean sometimes getting very very bored about my daily tasks so you know how we saved his API this is not something that I ask myself every day so being able to shape something that others might be using any future or might help others eyes pretty exciting

  
 and you know we should like to you know half of an impact and be part of the funeral. They're the community and the future that's that's the best thing you can do pretty much minimum effort super alright we'll put a link to that Discord channel in the show notes awesome any any last words I think we've

  
 do you have any final things you want to say well I can only ask you every asked everyone for checking out this week native even if it's not really that scary some people are saying you no reason to mail Blaster react-native that's like to early-stage the college East mixed together asking for trouble but it's not I promise you I promise. There is the community the community is very helpful mean I don't like like this is the this is the only community in the world where you can get an answer to your question on the chat server and they're like 5 minutes like I've never be part of such a helpful community and I'm really thankful for you and everyone proven you know building in the middle from the beginning for creating a such a friendly and welcoming environment

  
 well I'm I'm glad that's a that's your experience where do we put a lot of effort into that

  
 well thank you for coming on the show and telling us all about BS react-native and best of luck going forward thank you very much I'm looking forward to this well thank you
