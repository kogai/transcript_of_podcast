  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 19 February 14th 2018 so the first bit of news is that we now have new teams that's right it feels like we just got a few more teams and now we have four more if you've read Aaron's roadmap RFC post and there he talks about having focus in 2018 focusing on certain areas or certain tasks that really need to be accomplished so that we're covering the best ground for rust there for area is that Aaron called out webassembly embedding creating servers and networking and creating tools for the command line each of these now has a special group focused on it if you are interested in things like the command line you have a group now that is focus on just making the best man experience as they can

  
I think of the show notes so you can read more about these new groups and if you're interested you can find out where to get involved or next news item I don't normally give a shout out to commercial Ventures like things were you can buy me things unless it's books so this next one is about books The Humble Bundle now has a Humble functional-programming Bundle for us programmers and it covers the whole bunch of programming languages if you're not familiar with the Humble Bundle you can pay as much as you want and it's certain tears you get an additional set of books at $15 US you can get the full set of books and that includes the programming Rust book from O'Reilly is very cool it's much cheaper than you can buy the digital copy yourself and already over 17,000 people have purchased this bundle so here's hoping there's a lot of new people that will be looking at Ross for the first time

  
next let's talk about some of the things that are coming down the road for the rest compiler the first one of these is that Alex Creighton has put together a Cindy stabilization proposal Cindy has been around the compiler for a while but hasn't really had a chance to stabilize it's been pretty tricky Alex put together a proposal to stabilize Cindy and that proposal is now and its final call for comments another item that's been waiting in the wings for a while is specialization Nico massakis posted recently a new idea to tackle this really tricky topic specialization known for its key role and being able to optimize generic code is really important for rust in its long-term so I for one am really looking forward to seeing it land in the compiler

  
and finally for a news let's talk about a couple of new tools some of you may already be familiar with the website quicktype this is a way of being able to write Json and then get code corresponding to working with Jason I'll put on the right hand side they just recently added support for Rusty can output Json on left hand side and see the rust on the right hand side that you would use to interact with that Jason is super cool you know you can write the dress code by hand you could always do that but it's nice to have an automated tool where you just dump some data copy and paste and keep going the last two I want to talk about is a another website called Depp's that's d e p s. RS those of us who are shall we say a bits of a lazy maintainer for our crates you know we could we have reasons steps. RS shows which crates are out of date but they're dependencies it's a cool website to keep you honest I'll link that in the show notes you can call

  
you can check your own crabs out to see just how far out of date you are and with that that is a wrap thanks again so much for listening and keep on resting

  
 some of you may already be familiar with the good Lord I can't talk today
