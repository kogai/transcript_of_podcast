  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 15 January 17th 2018

  
 our first news item is pretty it's pretty cool so the atom code editor what you may have heard of I'm sure many of you use it even has an ounce recently that they will be moving part of their code based trust this is an effort to improve the overall performance of the atom editor so really encouraged to see this early usage of rest and we hope they grow to include even more R Us in the future

  
 this next news item is about the O'Reilly book some of you may already have it in your hot hands so the first printing of the programming rust O'Reilly book has now been sold out that's right you can no longer get that first printing unless you go find one that someone is already bought the second printing is already on its way so no worries there won't be any long delays before you can get your hands on it if you don't have it already but it's so cool to see how many people are excited about the programming Rust book and a rust in general that it's starting to sell out that quickly I mean it's only been on the market for a couple of weeks

  
 and speaking of books there's a new Rust book out it's called Step Ahead with rust it's by Jonathan Creekmore and James Miller now I haven't had a chance to read it myself as it just came out a few days ago I hope those of you who have tried it let others know what you think

  
 for this next news item let's talk a little bit about Russ governance Eric T has overseeing the community team for a while now is stepping down and Ashley Williams will be taking this place as part of this transition Ashley will be joining the ruscorr team

  
 as I'm sure you may have seen there is actually new teams starting up as well so we had seen the effort structure team that's been around a little while and stepping down from the infrastructure team and Aiden Hops and stairs is taking over Aiden help create a book on Docker obviously has some skills there with the infrastructure piece of it so really encouraged to see him take on this new role as intakes on this new leadership Elsa becomes part of the core team but that's not all there's one more core team change and in fact there's a whole new team to go behind it so they're splitting off the released him from the infrastructure team this is a really specific to just releasing Rost and testing they sure that each release of us is at the highest quality that can possibly be and Mark simulacrum is taking over that role as the lead so he also will be joining the rest Court you that makes three new Russ core team members

  
 and a lot more energy going into war directions if you've seen the announcement for the new release team then you probably have already seen that there is already probably close to a dozen people that have volunteered to help out on that team for those of you who been following the Tokyo news there's a new library out called H2 that focuses on htv-2 this is pretty cool I know a lot of people have been waiting for this so I'll link it in the show notes like I mentioned last week we have this hashtag rest 2018 going on right now this is a opportunity if you are in the rust Community to blog about your experiences with rust and where you hope Ross will go in 2018 there's already been tons of post but don't worry if you have ideas that you want to share please do but I definitely courage you to read a few and also offer up your own thoughts

  
 and that's it for this week again thanks so much for listening and keep on resting
