  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 5 October 25th 2017 and let's kick things off at the bit of gaming news now this news came out of tunnel left field I don't think anyone was expecting it to game developer chucklefish which is known for independent video games so you may have heard of Starbound for example they also are the producer for the very popular stardew Valley which is really awesome game really fun

  
so they came out and started to talk on the rust Reddit now in this Reddit thread they're talking about a new game that they're working on called Spellbound now they can't say too much about it the contractile reasons but the developers did say that this new game is written completely in Rust and for a lot of these rust redditors reading. I'll go wait a second here is a publisher we've heard about here is a new game that were interested in and icing on the cake it's written in Rust

  
sorry next news item is about webassembly support in Rust now you may have heard of webassembly before it's a cross-platform application format that currently Works across all modern browsers up until a couple weeks ago the support for webassembly really required a lot of finagling to get all the pieces in place so that you could build an application and Target webassembly so recently a new Too Cold War go which is car go with a W was released and its job was to Target webassembly so it makes a job a targeting webassembly a lot easier than what we had before

  
Alex Creighton from the Russ team has also been actively looking at webassembly so he released a questionnaire and is currently looking at some possible ways that we can make by the assembly targeting a lot easier okay let's see if I can say this last piece of rust news with a straight face

  
 so they Mozilla JavaScript team has just released a new experimental just-in-time compiler called holy jit that is Holy jit for just-in-time compiler Sussex pyramidal system is a way of making it easier to create just-in-time compiler is now it's still early days if you look there's very little code in the repository but I still an interesting experiment and for a bit of Servo news if you fuse Lenox and especially if you use they can own desktop you may have heard of gstreamer which is the multimedia playback system that they use recently one of the gstreamer developers took gstreamer and plugged it into Servo so that you can play multimedia Clips using gstreamer from Servo has a really couraging to see how much as possible and only a week's amount of time we're definitely looking forward to seeing what more is possible using gstreamer in the future

  
 and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
