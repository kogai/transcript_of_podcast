  
this is our intro music

  
 downtown downtown welcome to reason Town boys and girls ladies and gentlemen everyone people and we are on episode 14 I believe I wrote down episode 39 Hospital fix that today were talking about Auto serialization and full stack I realize by listening to other podcasts that we don't introduce ourselves every episode and we should know it's true I am Murphy Randall I work at a company called A1 live in Utah I am a software engineer software developer whatever is the best title for that job I am John Forsythe I also live in Utah I work for Khan Academy which is the online education non-profit that's working to build a Freewheel classification for anyone anywhere that is a great headline and you doing a great job at Mustang and we are doing this podcast because we want to help encourage the reason Community to grow we want each people that how it works cuz it's a very small community right now and

  
 we are on the bleeding edge I'm using it very very heavily at work at day 1 and Jared you are heavily contributing to reason that you aren't using it at work at Khan Academy right that's right I work on proper tooling and I have a couple of production projects side projects listeners I also there's something else I always forget to do but it would really help us if you write us iTunes oh yeah whatever podcast player you are listening to so if you want to get the word out about reason and help get the podcast out there please give us a rating or just remind us to remind you to do that again at the end of the Show sponsored by Tyler, the linear course based approach to learning web Technologies Tyler is a fantastic person and he's a good teacher so please go learn from him he's a lot of reaction learning resources and other things up there and I talked to him

  
 about who his Target audiences and he says mostly it's people that wake up and you know that they've been doing jobs here for a while or they they learned on backbone or jQuery that's like yours this world full of react and other things here's how you can really ramped up to the latest technologies that sounds like you go check it out having a good time is a good resource for sure so we are glad to be associated with him also sponsored by day one of the company I work for you like journaling check it out you'll hear more about what we're doing a little bit later in the show but first let's get to the the first order of business which is bucklescript the Buckle script roadmap blog posts which came out this week looks like we're upgrading the old camel compiler to 4.0.4 .06 I shouldn't say we cuz I'm not doing any of it but yeah so

  
 various channels including the the state of recent survey is people want more transparency about developments that are happening you know what is what is going to happen the Buckle strap what is going to happen no reason syntax let's develop more in the open and Bob has been doing bucklescript for several years and mostly just go by himself making awesome things happen Bob's that dick or backless Crypt guy that's right everyone's thing and that's his name that we talked about but it's because my mom or humble and but so it in response. He's written up a blog post about what his plans are for the next 6 months with Buckle script one of the biggest thing has been working on for like I think the past six or eight months it's a huge project to upgrade Buckle skip to use

  
 more recent version of oh camel so let's remind everyone that reason is a syntax bucklescript is a tool chain that compiles okay Mall the JavaScript and so they're okay moves ahead without Buckle script right right so like oh camels on its own development program buckles crabs catching up and they're far ahead like years ahead right now so includes a fork of the Ocala compiler and the fork is is quite old the most recent release version of a camel is 4.07 and they're going to be releasing 4.08 next year and by the difference between 4:02 and 4:06 is is really large there's lots of new features that we're going to get when this bus trip to upgrade completes including probably the coolest from my perspective is in line records I would just clapping screen right now it wouldn't blow your ears out cuz that that's super

  
 yeah so this is when you have a type that is very Constructors so a a union type each of those Constructors can have a record as opposed to just like Tupelo arguments or primitive yeah you can define a record non in line and use that type in a rank structure but it's just a huge objects play type on the keyboard like I can be a pain to type them at does that was supposed to be a fun night was bad I'm sorry about that another thing there's a bunch of updates to the way that they're compiler internally represents things which will allow for better in life

  
 in lining there's a there's a no camel decorator that you can put to say always in line is function or never in my inspection and that can be really important for performance characteristics hopefully in the next couple months that will be finished I don't know about this but I Heard it Through the Grapevine that the next four put that the current okay well at least 4:07 has row polymorphism like in coated effects is that the case do you know and they are we going to get that pretty cool that

  
 Rivera CIA so I'll be very surprised if records can't reply morphism objects have them but they're really hard to use

  
 so what will he'll see cuz I heard that like purescript style affect his data we're coming in where you can say like all the return type of this function is X but it has the side effects that are that are typed as why so maybe rope on them too and code if Patty facts that's why I said that he has been coming for like 4 years hopefully it won't take another 4 years the the people implementing it decided to split out the multi-core project from the type to fix project so we tell me about multi corsola Pokemon native isn't multi-core does not have shared memory

  
 ilysm

  
 the only multi-process only multi-process parallelism you can yeah you can make a thread and you can send things to the thread but you can't have shared memory in the way that for example rust because of its guarantees around ownership when you are passing something from one thread to another year he doesn't have to be copied need to pass pointer and it doesn't have shared memory parallelism and in order for it to be safe it needs types of facts and so these two things have been going at the same time but the type of fact stuff is more complicated

  
 maybe so that they're going to do multi corefirst with unsafe effects this is my understanding and then they will add on the typed effects to make the effect safe so I think multi-core is kind of one to two years out side effects is probably 3 to 4 years out okay that is a significant amount of time out still yeah I thought I heard that it was already in a recent release know as far as I understand it I got very excited about tact Effect 2 years ago when I first heard about them and I was like all this is going to happen just give me so great here we are two years later Della happening it's still it's still not there but

  
 yeah it's it's still going to be so great when it happens okay well let's look forward to that that's exciting stuff alright next item webassembly Telsa will simply Jared was going on so Sanders buys is working on a webassembly back-end for old camel which is super cool it I talked to him a couple weeks ago I talked to him a couple weeks ago about how it's going and there are some critical things that was simply doesn't yet have that would be necessary for the work ticket okay most notably garbage collection okay so okay I'm all reason they're garbage collected rust notably is not so making web assembly for rust was a lot easier than bringing Oak Hill assembly assembly folks are working on garbage collection and tail calls or another

  
 I'm also a stack that is managed by wasm as opposed to having to maintain a function stack separately so couple things will link to the blog post that talk more about it but kind of short answer is webassembly Ocala sport isn't coming immediately because we're waiting on webassembly of letters but it definitely as possible and will come as soon as those pictures come out to tell I have a couple questions about that first question is

  
 isn't okay I'm all employment agency and season garbage collected correct running so they did they write their own garbage collector and wouldn't that just translate over the web as am I don't know how that works but like why couldn't why can't you use the garbage collector that's part of the language Ocampo

  
 the compiler yeah so you probably could you can do something like I'm script in a massive yeah yeah I see similar to you know when is it it's not on the same levels buckles cookbook kind of similar to let's take ochem alternative JavaScript let's I go in with her and Walzem idiomatic Walzem so that it's as fast as possible so tell me then about the API API that are exposed won't be the if you guys are available in like Co camel it's not going to be going to be like opening a file descriptor and stuff to run to work with the files this is going to be web API sitter available like

  
 the language syntax is still another send text to Terry the semantics of the language remain your contract your records everything is none like platform-specific would be usable okay and then any standard library that doesn't use libraries that that our system specific would work and probably other compiler of religions work is they provide see stubs you know when when it calls out to something and see you provided a different location of those language so potentially you know JavaScript binding for that or whatever it is interesting that's a question that had for all languages are talking about moving to well bathrooms and like okay but what about the standard Library like what about your ecosystem because the language itself is one thing but also what about all the things you depend on you know and I would like to those were in the browser or maybe not so

  
 there is a experimental standard webassembly library that that Bridges to a bunch of Township is that let you interact with the dumb yes I live. I just think of that bridge I felt like that was another step that webassembly so hard to answer was kind of like the webassembly to Dom bridge for example you write so so it is it's across the bridge currently be still get the the benefit of not having to like Parts your JavaScript freezing point and that's a significant cost so you can ship a binary anything it's good to go interesting so you think we're still a couple years out for me having usable webassembly in Ocala

  
 I don't know why would somebody's been developing pretty fast I it's certainly not within the next 6 months I'd say but maybe within the next year we could have some something to mobile okay and this is an alternative to bucklescript because it's just a completely new back end that's right and you wouldn't just like as long as we can as long as we can go to Oak Hamilton tax if we can with reason well it's more than that right because it's as long as you go to the Oklahoma St then we can use a back-end that's really interesting as you're doing that work for very excited she ate it okay what's the event stream Fiasco that we're doing this record I figure we might as well mention the thing that look pretty this morning which was another I mean kind of left Pad but malicious and left

  
 was a great big like business and emotional explosion Fiasco that took down half the web couple years ago was built systems when it's like I'm trying to install and I can't because the maintainer of left pad got upset with the way India was doing things removed all of his package so event stream was compromised by what it seems to be someone who wanted to steal people's Bitcoin wallets okay that sounds for sure that gets to million weekly downloads but the maintainer doesn't hasn't been maintaining it for a while they don't use it as open-source happens you know that the person who originally wrote it is no longer invested in it right and apparently some weeks ago somebody email. Maintainer saying hey do you want help me

  
 event stream I'd be happy to help so the person got admin permissions to figure out an 10 p.m. and Linkedin so they found an issue but one of the issue said oh could you add flat map to this library and so the the attacker created and then p.m. package that was called flat map something that had some legit code in it off you skated and then added that dependency close the issues that affects it and then put out a new empty Emily's that have them look at it so

  
 kind of a big deal I mean not necessarily a big deal unless you're working with a Bitcoin but it it really exposes it could have been a lot worse

  
 in our ecosystem yeah I mean it once again most problems are people problems right because that was a social engineering thing no lock files are nice right if you have a locked file then you won't automatically upgrade to this and as long as this is found out in public then you'll know I shouldn't tell you I found it you link to an issue so 6 days ago somebody open an issue on this repo and said hey what happened this is weird and then this morning it got a lot of traffic Gary Bernhardt tweeted about it a couple other people did as well and so it got a lot of publicity so I was wondering who finds those issues like who saw it and said hey there's office gated code in here let me figure out what it does right and so during the course of today people were trying to

  
 not what the code does you can see in the issue comments weather like okay I see you know here's this md5 or you know this may be a 64 and coded so I decode it and it looks weird it's doing these things I don't know what it's doing so it links to this other script or whatever LOL I said do we know if anyone's Bitcoin wallet got pwned I don't know probably that's the reason this person the attacker targeted this package is because it's used by a Bitcoin wallet and p.m. package and so did the idea is a auto update their dependencies and then it all

  
 go from there I don't know if that actually came to fruition or weather was caught in time so I guess the points to take away is here are like if you are a maintainer of a library that's used by a lot of people there's a lot of trust on your shoulders even though you don't you're not really under obligation to maintain it right but you are kind of under obligation once people trust you to not give it to it an attacker right in response to this it says as an old adage goes capitals this software provided without any warranty explicit or implied that the MIT license yes we just purchased legally true yeah but if you want to the internet I guess be careful who you let into your repo alright I guess it's a question the problems of having infrastructure that's based on unpaid labor that has a high degree of burn out like that and then like trust in control right as because we all are

  
 kind of believe that our fellow developers want to do good and so when we get an offer to help for you want to accept it and who's going to go vet you know like a background check on the person I could have done here she got to know if it's a he or she could have done to validate that person's character sound like it's going to come out you know so I don't know about you know I'll wait for them to make me feel contributions over a couple of months and then give them the keys or whatever something like that got the atom to her right

  
 that's scary thanks for making the world a scary place people and that gets the other wasn't as use a locked file into unless you locked into the the bad library then then upgrade your luck but yeah well thanks for scaring us. You tell us about your auto serialization project is a new thing is if you didn't have already in a project right so what month or so ago I started a new front end project with reason we acting all this good stuff and I wanted to see realize 2

  
 two level DB right so simple key value store I need to serialize the the data that I have a bunch of nodes that have content and being modified date and various things and I had all the stated to find in reason types

  
 and I thought myself wouldn't it be nice if I didn't have to write you know hundreds and hundreds of lines of serialization deserialization code for the state of it I just want to pack into a Json string that would be nice so I I took some of the guts of the reminder server which does a bunch of work to analyze the types that are in your files so that it can provide nice IDE things and also connecting up types deeply right so this type uses this type uses this type in different files whatever I'ma takes care of that and I was able to use that information to make it to where you say okay in this file this type generate me serialization deserialization for this whole type deeply that sounds amazing is that a CLI and it

  
 I need you can you can specify multiple entry point types and you do this and I can pick file types. J son and then it generates a lock file for those types which means when you go in later and you changed one of the types and you like you want to be able to read the previous version that you've serialize the database and then upgrade it to new version

  
 and then sir like that it the old version of the types of saved in the lock file so when you regenerate your cereal this material Nation code it can read the old like all of the previous version of type generator code for do a destabilizing upgrading those and and then it if their migrations that can't be automatically done like you added a new record field you have to tell me how to do that you can have a decorator to the type to say here's how you migrate this field

  
 my mind is blown oh my goodness that's amazing so is this experimental this is my project for a while before releasing it just to Iron Out various Kinks but it I think it has a lot of potential there are lots of evaluated several other automatic civilization libraries and the the big Missing Link was migration yeah that's crazy I've never even thought of somebody challenge attacking a challenge to the such a big challenge I just figured you just deal with it but that's like how did you do that

  
 how much out like that sorry that's way too wide of a question but in the case of like a field changing his name how do you know that that's what happened or is that were use a decorator so I have a I have a piece of data that represents the previous record and the fields in it and then the new record the fields in it and I say for every record in the Fairfield Inn new record either it exists and is exactly the same type as the previous one then I just say you know use the previous field or there has to be a decorator indicating how to produce this new field basically you get an error saying I I I can't do this you need to tell me why so are these these decorators are they PPX like what time it's at The Decorator is a function from the previous record value to the new field value thing I don't know about

  
 okay so that's just a thing where you could say this is like a custom decorator the compiler will be okay with it you don't have to have a PPX to make that work the the compiler will ignore it okay if that's okay and but it is present in the impeller artifacts that reason language server processes okay so so my my tool I'm calling it type bigger right now but it it reads the compiler artifacts and see to find out the types and all of their dependencies and it also can see oh there's some decorators on this decoration I will use that when I'm generating the migration now so these decorators just so that I'm clear the Syntax for those is that also a buckle Scrappy's is like at vs. Who is a drone that a compiler doesn't care about them except for I guess bucklescript obviously cares about them or know the compiler nose like when you're using an invalid X

  
 the compiler will potentially raise a warning so there's there's the app and there's the percent sign extension points which take the place of a nasty note okay take the place of some code contract and if at the end of running all PPX is there are still some of those then at the type of her because you know this is supposed to take place in something it's not supposed to still exist right but they like the at vs. If I write happy ass up Foo I get a warning is like there's no such great Buckle script razors that helpful thing okay it looks for anything that starts with the S. Okay and if it's on used or if it's not real it will raise a warning about that so I could just have it at I could just do like at Murphy. Smiles and I don't care that's right but it would it would include that in the in the compilation artifacts

  
 think by the Indian term yeah wow so how much you going to charge for this package when it's really know they were talking about the dangers of free software that's all it is so there's also and I will steal your Bitcoin wallet address so what are the plans for it as a joke I didn't get the sarcasm I think you know it's definitely there a bunch of features of the Oklahoma language that I don't use very much that it doesn't support right now I'm at doesn't support polymer polymorphic variants which can be nice it doesn't support any of the object types of the other thing that I didn't mention

  
 you can buy custom cereal cerealized there's four types that are opaque is this just Json serialization or So currently I just have it to Jason it is expected in such a way that you could have multiple actually there are two back right now one is a closer place on and the other one is for Native interesting is it easy to write your own back-end is that a thing that you going to make pluggable like what if I wanted to do Pro 2 right I think

  
 that they're probably few enough back instead I'll just make it so you pull request the depository and or or you could use this as a library and make your own and I'll be fine too that's awesome how long did it take you to do that total ripping out the the guts of the existing staff let's see

  
 a bunch of hours I don't know I mean so so making type Tiggers been the work of maybe the past

  
 month-and-a-half

  
 I don't know probably at least 30 hours now I'm surprised I haven't heard about it until now that's awesome what are some of that takeaways from it the lessons learned from it

  
 it's so nice to have a type system when you were factoring like so many times I was going through it was like okay if make this change you know I will just go through and fix all the papers and then it works first try the I didn't have any logic errors because defining everything in types help me out so much and yeah they're just so many times when it's like oh I'm going to have to go through a couple of iterations on this actually I just work the first time

  
 speaking of that topic is there any other Lessons Learned or it cuz I have I have something on that topic to on the topic of refactoring I'm in the middle of a major risk factor right now on the new sync server for day one and POI it's all driven by Our Last podcast conversation because too many weeks ago but that's where we talked about are handling rights I thought more carefully about it and I relist into our conversation on the podcast and I came up with a plan for how I wanted to change that I'm checking the notes to make sure that it's okay we talked about this yet looks like it actually no it's not we're skipping I'm going to reorder the notes so I kind of encoded in my mind I wrote a blogpost and I put it up on them. Too and I talked about kind of an approach to handling errors and I want to go over quickly in case I'm not the only person who's never I never thought of this until this point

  
 but I really like what you said in the last episode Jared where you said that the like run throwing a runtime exception is appropriate for a server application when your whole server needs to crash

  
 aggressive approach saying you can throw but you can't catch me can't catch so I kind of took that it as the plan I'm saying like Okay well I can never throw an exception in my server unless I'm expecting the whole application to crash you know camel you can catch so they're libraries that throw so you're at your responsible for for catching things but I'm never going to like property right so I'm going to do all results type stuff and so I also took member how I told you I had this feature library that I'd written cookie crumbs are really not very helpful because they're not very descriptive and then maybe they mostly just make big fat error messages and so what I needed instead well okay sorry let me go back and we're talking about the difference between throwing exceptions and handling errors as data so what I realized was that you have two different situations two different

  
 to err is basically you need to you have errors that the computer needs the server needs to know about because the logic of the application after the earthquake needs to change and then you have errors that the programmer needs to know about because the programmer needs to change the code of the application and make a new deployment basically right and then there is like everything between doesn't matter basically like they know if there was just a failure or fetching something like that that deal just you just retry it again because there was a network failure like don't lock it whatever I was like well like what's the interaction between logging and handling failures basically and that's when I realized that there's a useful division here where when when something can fail that's that you you go ahead and program and don't ever worry about areas until you get to a point where you can have a failure which is usually around I owe so there's somebody of operation there is a possible failure and then you need to ask yourself as the programmer

  
 if this fails am I the am I the developer the only person he needs to know why it felt like the details of why it failed or does the application need to know that so two different examples for that would be like let's say I'm trying to atomically update a counter in my database so that the rest of this request can continue and I can like let this user finish signing up maybe for example right if I can't update that Atomic counter the operation is best there's nothing else that can happen in this request so I returned to 500 status code there's the application doesn't need to know anything other than I couldn't do what I needed to do I have a board is I failed in that circumstance basically like you can just the application can receive an error results like if you're using if you're including your data's as a result type you return an error of unit because they have

  
 she needs to know nothing about that at the point where that failure happens you leave a detailed log for the human who's going to be reading the logs that says this I couldn't update the counter is exactly what happened everything is aborted right I like them a lot so you're like a my humidor in my computer right so every time that the that the human of the only one who needs to know the information you just return an air of you and that's that sit on the other hand maybe you're in the situation where your writing authentication and point and you say okay I've gotten this user the off token I'm going to make a request out to the user service in my multi in my like microservice to get back either at 2 or a 4:03 or 1 or maybe some other status code of like 500 or something like that maybe date maybe they had a problem right now I'm so in that case your application doesn't need to know what happened it doesn't it not either like Oh either the user

  
 added together they didn't write because you need to let the user know oh sorry the optic did the user service says either that user doesn't exist if it gets back at 4:04 or before hundred like you didn't include the password or something or a 401 sorry you're not authorized that user password, but doesn't exist like they're they're all these pieces of information that your server needs to head back to the user based on the results of that thing that could fail and if it's a 500 then you just throw so that's in that circumstance use a result type and you have as they're in the error side of the result type the data that lets you decide whether to tell him it was me not to try again because it was a server failure or to do to change their password because they were using the wrong one so like that's so so the Walker says if you're human logins for humans leave detailed logs right at the source of the error contain include enough context to fix the problem when you see it

  
 if you are if your application needs to know about it that's the only time you need to include information in the result type that allows you to do adjust the application that allows the application to adjust his execution path without a code change that make sense fascinating that was super helpful because it's simplified my my types significantly because I rewrote the future library and all it became was and they're already applied raised like this up on read acts but it was the reason package index but it just became a promise of a result and with utility methods and that's it feel like it was a promise that never fails and the the always resolving value of the promise was either a result okay or results are taking over the air and mapping of the result and boy that's really cool because I've got like a future of the value or the failure value and Moe's

  
 to the time it the failure value is unit and that that actually been propagated down to my Express handlers now became a future of either

  
 Express like either Inn Express response or an Express response so now I can say either of these rest seated or it failed at the status with some other piece of data that is cool cuz then you can like a board early and this this actually helped me to do typesafe middleware Inn Express very simply so I now have a composable middleware solution which I have none of them talked about it before cuz it was really, but this uses future type this composable middleware solution now it says like okay so I'm going to do this all this user stuff I required the authorization in point in the body parts beside the authorization Middle where the body pressure Middle where those are typesafe those each add something onto the contacts that you can reach REM which is way cool and and the return types of those like either of those middleware either succeed and pass along data so like the authorization Middle where it says Oh either I see

  
 see you tonight at a user to the contacts or I fail with an Express result so it says like I can exit early and say sorry it's at 4:01 so that that all kind of clicked into place really easily because of realizing I needed to separate logging and air handling cool which is sweet so I'm thinking about this from the context of CLI tools which I do a lot of and on the one hand if for your example the programmer versus the application logic I think of the programmer versus the end-user site if if

  
 if there is a config file that is malformed that's not the point where it's called that's the end-users fault or you're missing this after mute in this config file and so it's it it seems like that the same concept applies here as well yeah it definitely like it's all about getting the right information to the person who can change the thing that's got to fix the problem right there you go it's really important if you're maintaining a web server to be able to have logs strung together in a request thread so I talk to you about this off off podcast but I'm I was researching ways to come up with like a request thread sorry that's the wrong way to say it

  
 sort of like a request ID and attach it to every one of the logs that happened in the request so that's how I wanted a problem and this is kind of sticky it's kind of annoying because in other language is the aren't nodejs you have thread local context basically thread-like threadlocal memory here's the idea of the request it's on the memory I can attach it to Locks and no there is just one threat and there's just one block of memories of switching between request all the time so they're there is some funky there a lot of people who thought about this problem and there is like an experimental feature and no that's called a sink hooks that allow you to like hook onto function execution in and modify the memory and there are libraries that specifically have said like okay so basically it's like continuation local storage is what it's called the idea is like in a wrap in a function that calls other functions you can set some

  
 memory and access it within those deeper functions and evidently it works pretty well until you reach third-party libraries are unaware of it and destroy the context so so have you tried using it and half way through okay and here goes the transition to the next thing I was going to say

  
 who's the lot of wind today but what happened was I was happy to that we factor and then Thanksgiving break started to come and we realize that we needed we wanted to ship a new feature and a one where users could buy gifts for other users where you can buy a year of premium for other users and so I tabled the ra factor which is where I wanted to say hi to extremely important because I was able to take on this ra Factor the basically touch every piece of the application that used any kind of a sink code which is massive amount like or like I could not have a trying to do that we Factor would have been extremely painful without types of leaving the ra factor in the middle application thing you know because these are factors if you don't have types you have to have everything in your head all the time and leaving it would have been like just killing the ra factor and so amazing

  
 kudos to reason for letting me just say well I'll just switch get branches and I'll come back to this later because I want to place my place right and I'll just continue to refactor there which is really sweet and let me talk really quickly about the day one gifts project because almost all of the new server functionality we needed in our in our nodejs reason server and that was Snappy fast and lovely I mean we're using Asura and graphql like I've been talking about her past episodes we were able to just writes the add some new data type store postgres database expose them via Asura and then just ricrac you all queries to interact with our database on the reason side very easy to ride the reason it was wonderful than give us and we were able to move fast and that was great we were still using the old future type so that's going to have to refactor those cigarettes

  
 but thanks for the types you know so the server was was great and we weren't even talking about that but we hadn't at this point Dental whole lot of Reason react we've done a bit of experimental client work that's yet unreleased but it's been like months and months so we just drove right back in and our setup is totally not fancy but actually did was I just have like a folder in my reason is first directory called front and like I just saw the same name space right so we're all just Joshua house in the back end exactly yeah I can just I can actually just use types that are straight up shared between if I want to I didn't end up doing that but I could just be like all this Utilities in this folder I'm going to use it and as long as it wasn't also in the same module as some like no negative thing from depend on anything right which side that did happen so I had to extract some things

  
 that was super easy and so what I did was those those files I also have a naming convention where I'm like oh instead of like login in point it's login page right it says simple enough sure to do and so that gets compile the JavaScript and then webpack I just add a new entry point so what pack has you have the ability to have multiple entry points and those will automatically right out based on their file name to multiple right points as well for each page I didn't want to have to deal with server side and client-side routing I wasn't worried about like bundles being too big I wasn't really worried either about the time it takes to load a page and Bruce. The JavaScript I'm not at the point where I need to at this at this point for business so webpack it was pretty sweet I just said okay well I have the login page at a new endpoint webpack a new entry point

  
 it takes login page. B s h a s and it generates static / login / bundle that day us and then I've got a fully functioning reason react app right there and I just did that for each page so I had it was pretty darn close to like your good old this is just HTML almost as good as like this is just index. PHP easy almost that easy to use and and that would make edits in reason and it would to compile and I mean my bed set up and made it difficult to get those changes at quickly but we still had like a couple seconds to turn around time to like see what was going on the page that was fast enough and CSS which is a like a functional CSS Library where you all you're doing is adding class names and I haven't I already had a good opinion of it before we started and I have a higher opinion of it

  
 after having used it for the project it was great to work with super cool so fast I was just like usually I get I get lost in the mire CSS because I've used it for many years and I have and I can tweak to death CSS but the great thing about Tailwind as you follow kind of some conventions kind of rails as it sounds like rails for CSS okay since I convention over configuration some degree and so instead of worrying about like doing Pixel Perfect layouts which wasn't concerned with another was our designer I just said like this cuz you know you use the talent standards and boom boom boom and you customize it exactly like where it's really necessary like oh I need this actual background image I need my own colors but like as far as padding and spacing in font size like all those things work together pretty well already cool and

  
 I was done like a week and a half we turned around this project and it was we did a lot more than we had planned to do so there was scope creep of course like always happens but we got it done like the scope descope craft and we still managed to finish it was pretty amazing and we had a successful weekend too and it's like we sold a good number of gifts over Thanksgiving weekend in the head no I didn't have to check the server yet I had no concerns about about load I mean we're not that popular anyway but there's a success story from Thanksgiving. React in a week and a half to two weeks we hammered out a whole new future with with server tools that site admin tools I use the tool called tool retooled try retail.com which is like a dragon drop admin API like an admin user interface Builder

  
 okay it's like Cookie Cutter it doesn't look like your own thing so fast to get stuff done so we built an admin tools that are support people could view these these gift reassign them refund them generate certificates when they were lost and so I we were totally ready and it wasn't there was a thrilling experience so thanks to there's a success story for reason making a fast for us and for using tools like retool it's great to drop that in the links

  
 but what if they're my stories Jared that's I had lots of stuff to tell you and I thought I told you give me directions to hear about success stories using reason in production which is a good time for for me to mention you listeners out there if you are using reason in production we want to hear from you yes send an email to Jared at reason. Town or Murphy at reason. Town and include a little blurb about what how you're using reasoning production and you know benefits downside that kind of thing we're planning to make a blog post with with a bunch of Snippets of people that are using reason production and their experiences please please write in we would be glad to hear from you in fact we like to do a couple episode soon with other people

  
 Anonymous well so you know if you're using if you've been using reasoning production like I have any of battle stories to tell anyone to be on the podcast list now and we can call up and have a nice talk if you're nice we're not going to talk to see if you're mean that's right yeah

  
 well I think we beat this conversation to the ground we just have time for pics my pic is a reason Expo which I actually just started a new react-native app week ago using expo Expo is wonderful it is a kind of

  
 a bootstrap 4 react native apps and a kind of editor or a tooling environment that class is over a lot of the pain of getting started with reason we getting started with react native sorry so they they have a little. For that comes up and with a QR code that you can scan on your phone to start interviewing your app on device immediately if there's something weird with you know the local network and you can't get over the network they you can automatically tunnel through their servers to view your code live on your phone super slick experience that they also make snack which is an online react-native editor for trainings out I discovered today that there is a reason Expo library to

  
 do you react native with reason standard library or with with exposed interlibrary and it's reason bindings to that I'm sorry I should have done that I'm just doing old fashioned JavaScript right now all the fashion JS that's Rondo refactoring for you my friend that's right you better get it right the first time that's right okay what's your my pic is the keyboardio I don't know how they actually say it or keyboard. IO but this is Ben and I'm like a are going to make cool keyboard fanatic guy I've learned many over the years and my previous to the keyboard ago which I just bought I've I've had the kinesis

  
 what is breaking the keynesians with the curved handle the the curve finger Wells that you've you've seen that your company's sure it's the advantage to it's a great keyboard I love it and I also tried to your godocs easy which is also great keyboard needs bigger hands than I have but my the one I've liked the most of the keyboard out so I bought it used from the keyboard e l chat room I went and found someone who is in the midwest to who had purchased this and couldn't get used to it and so I bought it at a nice discount of the ship that out to me and it's got like a nice wooden wooden base that you put your hands on the keys are all custom switches that are mechanical switches there like just the right amount of clicky and actually has an Arduino Delta it runs on an Arduino so okay you edit the key map and macros and everything by plugging it into Arduino IDE IDE

  
 and liked editing the sea so is your keyboard going to have your refrigerator is my desirable great like this is the first gen sure it's still like if you go to the purchase side at the kickstarter and they're on their second batch now I think but his boy best Reuben in the light to use like each of the keycaps is specifically sculpted to its position on the keyboard and mouse ergonomic there for thumb keys on each hand and there's a palm key for the four function switches like if you depressed one of your palms all of a sudden the arrow keys are on the home row on the right hand by default all right and that's it's pretty interesting to get used to but it's very cool you can add as many layers as you like to the keyboard as well so like if you that there are other keys that I left open for you in a few depressed one of those keys you can enter into that a new mode and

  
 it gets even get here you can do stuff like that which I haven't done but each key has an LED behind it of different fancy but what people have done is like for example they've they've tied that into like their terminal and so if you enter a root shell your whole keyboard goes red so you remember that you like Madness app is pretty cool I haven't done it but it would be pretty sweet man on the keys if you press it draws like the letter for that key in the LEDs on like a four-by-four pixel grid around but definitely keep is a fun thing to play with and beautifully handcraft crafted and it'll also help your wrists you know a few you should be concerned about that I was going to say very concerned about that but most programmer should be concerned about

  
 preserving the wrestling term definitely so that's fun it's fun pic right there that's great. So once again please if you enjoy the show courageous on iTunes you can rest if you don't enjoy the show too but we will be sad about a one-star rating or whatever your podcast client is I'm so proud of things I never say this I'm trying to get used to it but thanks for listening I really appreciate it thank you bye
