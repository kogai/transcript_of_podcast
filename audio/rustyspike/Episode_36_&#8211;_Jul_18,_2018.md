  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 36 July 18th 2018 it's been quite a minute so let's get started there's a lot of news to catch up on the first news item this week is around clippy cookie being the style enforcement tool that's very popular with rust it's now available through rest up so now you can rest up install clippy I asked the lead for the dev tools team Nick Cameron if in the future this should be part of the larger RLS story more the ID support by the fall and he said yes that's definitely the plan our next news item is around the New Media Kodak av1 you may not have heard of 81 it's that new I think it hit its first man release only a few weeks ago falling on a series of Patton encumbered video codecs like MPEG now we have a V1 everyone not only a non-pay

  
unencumbered that is it's free to use you don't have to pay an ongoing licensing fee but maybe one also is a much higher-quality because it uses the most cutting-edge research in video codecs so that's pretty awesome how does that relate to rest so there's ongoing work in a very safe fast everyone in Kotor that is what takes the wrong video and then turns it into a V1 video this encoder it is written and rust called RAV 1 e or Robby of course link to it so you can check out the source code and if you happen to be a hacker that wants to help out can definitely do so let's switch gears away from video codecs to cryptocurrencies so one of the cryptocurrencies that are currently being developed as one called zcash tcash announced that its next major version called sapling has a chunk of rust coat in it this code will be handling the cryptography aspects of zcash in the future and they're really excited

  
about it so excited that they became one of the sponsors for Russ comp 2018 that's happening in a few weeks so that's awesome if you happen to be a cryptocurrency inclined person of course have the link so you can read a bit more about what they're working on and speaking of sponsors to Rusk on you know we talked about the lineup to Russ concert 2018 and how they're some pretty awesome speakers there but we haven't really taken a look at all of the sponsors you know in times past Russ conferences had you know a small handful of sponsors is it was a respectable start but if you'll indulge me let me just quickly read through some of the sponsors of rest stop 2018 starting at the top you have Mozilla Skylight AWS Amazon AWS POA which is part of the aetherium work in Traverse by do you get Hub parody galois zcash cumulo one signal polysync

  
bad Sigma digitalocean Ticketmaster pink cap are you kidding me come on that's awesome man of gold sponsors a ton of people that are very serious about their investment advice that want to put it out there and they're going to put their money out there as well hats off to all these companies that are supporting roskopf let's talk a little bit about software so a lot of people have probably heard of nginx which is it should be reverse proxy the engine X people released the rust blinding so these are official rust bindings nginx from the engine Xbox that's pretty awesome of course link to those if you're interested in checking them out kind of rolling back the clock a little bit further to stop that we haven't gotten to and pass weeks Ross 1.27.14 Point release was released in these past weeks if you haven't managed update yet definitely grab it there continuing to close some of this song

  
this holds that they're finding another thing that happened in previous weeks is that there was a music festival in Russia that served four hundred and fifty thousand people so that alone is pretty awesome let's just you know take a moment to appreciate how enormous nearly half million people at a music festival must have been like but the course the cool thing for this podcast is that lots of that Festival from ticketing to permissions to different areas of the Festival fairgrounds etc etc we're all driven off of dress code there is a cool right up on Reddit that you can read that talks about how they did each of the things with software that use with packages excetera one of the things that they talked about in that was how much they appreciated having something like actix web to build a software on that name may be familiar to some of you who've been closely following some of the news around

  
ticks in recent weeks a few weeks ago someone was looking through the code notice there is quite a lot of unsafe code in tactics web and then begin to look at how the unsafe code was being used one of the nice things of course about rust is that all your unsafe code gets put in your unsafe blocks which makes it easier to look through with a fine-tooth comb or people found is some of the uses of unsafe just work playing unsafe unfortunately and let the developers know I'm happy to report that developers responded very quickly and in the following weeks fix nearly a hundred uses of unsafe in their code I love that rust let you do that that allows you to quickly both audit the code and then it gives you a lot of power in the language to refactor so that those uses of unsafe you don't actually need him practice you can remove and you can remove them with a lot of confidence

  
shout out to the ACT accept people for reacting so quickly I know that you know I think one of the things about the rest community that is a strengthen maybe sometimes the occasional weakness is the amount of enthusiasm but thank you again for reacting so quickly I'm so glad that future versions of actix web people be able to rely on for their projects going forward your last news item let's talk a little bit more about auditing I mention how awesome it is that people can just jump in and audit packages in crates. IO we had one person in particular post a very lengthy analysis of a lot of crates on Reddit recently I'll link to this you can check it out but I think this is kind of a call to action I think this post is a good example that people can feel and power to go and look at rust coat in the wild and do their own analysis the kind of proved to themselves at the crates that they're using are safe to use and in cases were there not

  
to let the developers know that you know that particular use of unsafe may not be sound it may not be the best way to use the future and then maybe even better ways to do it I think this is one thing that if we keep it nice and friendly we can only further improved Rusk rates going forward

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and it's always keep on resting
