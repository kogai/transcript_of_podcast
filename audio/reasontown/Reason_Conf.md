  
hey everybody and welcome to reason town today we're going to talk about reason, and I've got some special guest here which I will introduce in a moment just after I say that our hosting is sponsored by Tyler McGinnis. Com the linear course based approach to learning web Technologies big thanks to Tyler and if you want to learn some sweet stuff go check out Tyler McGinnis. Com the link is in the show notes now and introduce Patrick stop there they say the right Patrick and I said the American Angus and I said I was just actually invoice is Andre aku-aku National Golf and he was detained from for family reasons wasn't able to make the show but definitely

  
I wanted to be your contributing so thanks Andre even though he wasn't able to be here so Patrick and Nick give us a very short well first I'll just say that you three Patrick Nick and Andre you are all co-organizers of the reason Kampf in Europe the reason, Austria 2017 that just recently ended and so we're going to talk about that in the show today so first things first but start with Patrick Patrick and Nick why don't you to give us like a 2-minute background on yourselves each so we can get an impression about where you're from you know what you're doing it's better give it a try so I'm currently a freelancer and I've been like most of my open source time out the best time in the float system and the funny thing is that you're older from the flu like assistant kind of and there was like super surprised when I see your nickname everywhere where I'm going like your hair

  
we met in the flow ecosystem like three or three years ago right isn't that was reviewing the laboratory conditions for professional time I was mostly working for a company called and they like infrastructure County the struction to health everything and build some amazing tools which are all open source which is called Lagoon Moses parking for a client called mixed triangle who are building kind of like the medium of scientific articles and I'm integrating old Campbell in their platform so I know the reason of course so you can use Oak Hamlin reason to build articles and computer stuff and I calculate the Big Data

  
how interesting that's great so how did you learn about reason how did you get into reason when I was working in the system and I was like discovering all the things you can do with a bunch of programming I woke up a little bit excited with its and I used to love the functional programming paradigms and the telescope but I always thought that there was something like in some kind of like to do like polymorphic typing with Rhonda and I was looking out for some like Nick and I we we looked into Elm and we were really excited about it but then there is a few things that I didn't like

  
most of it was that it was not running a note in the beginning I wanted to do some server stuff as well and we later on we will talk about this little bit later I'll tear your backstory for stack by from Falcons and then the Arts backbone and then talked in the front end and then I move to give me freelancer movement more to front and stuff and I was actually on the verge of like I was using angle of one at the time and I was in the bunch of like okay I got to go into management because I'm bad it's so hot and I felt like there's not much more I can do and then I started get in touch with reactants and completely blew my mind that I could really really excited

  
content development and if you did a tip. There and I don't know it was I think 2 years ago Center piece from from the Netherlands he talked about reason and I'm so that was really really on for reason that the conference reacting L and explain physically like in the way you like why I react that's what's so exciting for me because some something you could use me to vacate the structures in front end in the lot more functional programming and old made so much more sense and then become sane compared to to to this peak Angela projects that we had before that the burg every time you change something broke it in into other places and reactants case like it made it possible that we can actually set up something that when we change something between break it somewhere else yeah and then dance and explain it to me like here you can

  
Reckless physical coming from both sides but then we only can go south so far end and that totally saw this point and the other ways like okay let's take a functional programming language like oh, I think I'm from the other side the no reason react this like this this thing that sits right in between for front of development are you you have the good parts coming from react from the one side from the JavaScript side of the good parts coming from old camera with the synthetics You Need to Breathe by default and so on yeah that's how I kind of got into reason

  
nice so then there's a big step between just getting into reason and doing a whole conference cuz we know how much work that is so I understand that before doing a conference you organized to meet up together is that right yeah but and both of you are please both of you cannot contribute to I'm not sure if I remember it correctly but I was really like I know that the devil into reason like active count like 2 years ago

  
and I'm actually sitting like after the conference Ocean Grove was talking about it and I was really excited it's just was actually that the point which ignited this whole thing where I was like sitting in the hotel room and make and I will try to install the tool chain but it didn't work properly and was like super slow but they release new versions which were faster and then we are like okay we should really like we should do it we should find a group of people who are willing to invest some time trying it out in like in my programming kind of way I'll just get together and try to build something reason react yeah I kind of like this I'm not sure if it's like this like this

  
yeah I think I mean I really like the session since we had this way to two different repeat we have to react vietnamita but we also both gorgonize this since a long time no more than 2 years and a reason was a bit different though because we did this meet up so we had presentations now and then but then I would say the more interesting stuff was actually the sex sessions but we had just people come together usually just smaller just by because it's that the system is smaller for Vons photos of how we be explained it on the meter page actually come here and Decor together I don't know maybe it's cuz of some people but on the other hand it was some really really productive sessions were get Hands-On I do you learn something it's not like you want to talk for 2 minutes and your you got really inspired and then you get home and then the next day you do you bait shop

  
and I can try out all the cool stuff you actually in the sex sessions we eat we just say like oh cool new version of recently active looks completely different let's check it out and we walked in this tic tac toe toe game for quite some time and ran through some of the situations that reason reason react actually did see when you did that did you do it as a whole meet up together like you would do an Imam programming session and all of you would work on the same game is that how that worked yeah exactly I mean some people speak now than book that they had to go to another table and 10 so I can order stuff but yeah mostly was like my programming and how many how many attendees were there typically 10 you can look at now

  
and so so each time you met up with it like I know that I've been to some of that homemade UPS in San Francisco and they were not at all like around me that's in Utah cuz and I'll meet us in Utah a lot of people have families to get home to you and go to bed but in San Francisco the only have to go in till 2 or 3 a.m. people be hacking that whole time but kind of what was the time schedule for you guys looking like

  
 homeless mostly like started around 6:17 p.m. and then went until 10 I would say so it's not too long into the night but then usually we went for it and it kind of continue their okay so it's it's not it's not so much about like to eat in your not so Hands-On anymore but then you talk about philosophy the language and Sons Boston and there was a lot of things change happening there yeah that's where you form friendships that form businesses and initiatives later on right is that the socializing time so hopefully that's really interesting okay so so we'll be there was at some point where you said hey this reason Vienna is working out really well let's do a reason conference saying tell me how that went what was that decision making process like

  
 I think if I remember correctly the driving force was Patrick here maybe maybe we can talk more about it realistic with this whole thing in the beginning of us thinking why is there no proper events hurricane like some idea about how can I get a huge group of people together getting like bootstrapped with all the knowledge still needs and then fill them up with some kind of way because most of the people are

  
 like they can they can learn it in one day but they never take the time to to walk like one day and refreezing the Emma I always felt like okay we have two to three hours and and every time we try to get back to where we left off or we get Barbie Barbie stuff last time and was really frustrating because then people messed up their set up again and we needed to spend some time setting up their machines again and people got sidetracked and some things difficult to the last time so why don't you have something where we can redeem

  
 bootstrap is huge amount of people and I was also like lurking in the Discord and older community channels we had and it was in the old camel discus and I saw that there are a lot of people I'm just waiting for the moment where everyone is just getting to one place and building something great and get to know each other because a lot of people have been in the Dew Tour Channel and you happen to talk to each other but he never had the chance to two together and just talk about it in person right now and then I was up yeah that we had stays this huge discussion on how conferences are getting bigger and bigger and like here in in our region of Vienna and other countries next to it next to Austria and I was always wondering why I like smaller communities

  
 call you have like 120 to 150 people because then it's much much easier to to interact with each other and have a nice experience and we saw this without a conferences in Austria swell like in the end of Austria before I pack bird of us to Sherry small conference for childhood develop person and I think the problem was just the size of a conference so I wanted to have a small conference and and I wanted to have a very specific about reason and this was the the thing where I just went to Lincoln say okay we need to we need to start something we need to make it 3 days I was really crazy I was yeah we need to make it free days otherwise it doesn't make any sense yeah I know reaction across kind of like yeah let's do this

  
 so can you can you tell me then a little bit about the the actual leg work of getting a conference set up cuz I mean I've I've Got Friends to do this too and I understand that there is a lot of personal risk that goes into it a lot of work that goes into finding a venue committing resources getting you know they're putting out the cfp in the ticket sales and stuff to tell me a little bit about how you got the resources to do this and on the side and was it was a super scary did you find a nice way to do it going to hack the system tell me more most or like it is awesome very important kickoff point was it is really shady Pizzeria you have you had this meet-up Indiana cheritz and Cristiano from from the bottom and and trunk Rolfe the old where to meet at BK

  
 conference with service nearby and we could I could come out so I'll meet up and speak about it then so I'm and busy proposal from the recent call Tim and she liked it then I was like for us really important because we didn't want to do anything if lot not the core team is is is involved and yeah because if it's great to have to be aligned just like that and yeah I really like it yesterday was really important and then the next steps would be like setting setting up values false information and so on and so is Patrick mentioned like it was Ciara to grow too big because we had bad experiences with that we want to do things like from this the meat of swollen hands on this way more important so initially we set up the conference walked in the way that the first day

  
 only walk shops and everyone who bought a ticket was able to attend to Workshops the second day was full conference day and the first day was hecka dominant and tools in Vienna and everyone could attend to wash up and then was really important to us to get all the people on at least some of the same page that everyone at least used to try to reason and I think that worked really well in sand that was wonderful that you sent the other values are important thing to also factually at bring all the people to be seen and talked to chat on Discord bringing same room and and see what we can do with that yeah I think that also works well yeah and then it's turn off I don't know we had a lot of experience let me know if we just meet up to a hundred and twenty people also 830 so we have seen quite a huge amount of people ready

  
 that you dropped from like 20 to 30 40 then you keep it at that point experience how to deal with things get less stressed of a time she do this more often and I think that was a really important factor to actually execute because he know you have to guess you have to take care of me till you get here feeling rough feeling for like what catering cost what are the rules like legal stuff yet to take care of mums on and thoughts and deeds I think we underestimate the amount of work and actually track it for me it was roughly about $120 total where every second was just focusing on on Sunday Taylor freezing corn for organizing something in so long I mean that was spread to her for 5 months or so but still litter it's it's still quite an effort and then then you just do it

  
 do you reimage who created the nastiest and we we we ask people who do event management like what we need but what are we forgetting and edit stuffed and then just walked up on the one I think I still have it on my next stop tutus we want to extract all our lessons learned and introduce busy create the kids app repo for anyone who wants to do another reason fun in u.s. maybe what's up this is how this is all Playbook and even for us I think we still want to do pretty certain about doing one next year again pretty cool but I'm basically for us have a Playbook but even for everyone else hate this is a playbook for how to do recent confident that we think it works well feel free to take it modified PR against it

  
 you know you could do is you could build a conference standard I can open conference standard with RF rfc's and everything like that then people could just implement the standard and put on a conference that implements the open Conference Center there you go that's really cool that's super helpful because for a new person who's never organized like that before there's so much that I mean like I said I have friends who organize conferences and I had no concept before being friends with them that I mean. Like a huge part of putting on the conference it's just finding a venue and putting a down payment on the venue kind of thing to to make sure you have enough space with a good projector and good Wi-Fi for people to like how did you solve those problems with the Wi-Fi and the venue and stuff

  
 that was actually in our case it got kind of Lucky maybe it's everyone from the venue's I mean for once the typical Olympic conference room was at the Technical University and they allow you to pay later on maybe afterwards awesome and really helps but I think the point where the most nervous when was before selling any tickets because it would wear when absolutely not sure like how big is the community how many people would really come and yeah it was actually intense discussion to redo this and then we stop ticket sales event for lunch and 10 minutes later we sold 9 tickets and that got us some irregularly way to to pay for some flights and so on and then

  
 yeah Patrick who was the most positive or false he was definitely right of course this would like to create a concept we had when we started this whole thing with the free this is what I want. But if I like Cristiano telling us we we we we said okay maybe there will be a hundred people or something and Cristiano said like now there will be more and I felt so I got such a confidence boost that okay if the decor Chima freezes like so supportive and trying to make this happen and giving us advice on things and offering us help if we need it this was yeah we called that it's would have probably know what's happened so

  
 important and after that like talking to people and talking to people who have a little bit more inside Sandy Community I was totally sure that we will celebrate Easter Bieber tickets in the first month or something I don't know why but I was really counting how many tickets did you sell completely to sell it did sell out the conference right yeah hundred and sixty six people at the conference has a great pull up the stats stats for sponsors are very interesting thing because actually fix on Placentia came to us and there's an Innovations Department in there and they use reason for an Enterprise project and I like Express Customer Center there was an internal app that the customer

  
 to be able to visit account okay we it's it's not super critical so we can I use reason I find a Statin they said yeah sure and then they came to Austin said I can speak conferences but I think my niece is more well spent if we if we invested in recent Khan and yeah yeah I think it's blocking some cases definitely quickly where is it stats I can give you some stats don't know where to find them the other sponsors so for instance

  
 I hesitated contacting Chain Street in the beginning because I wanted to be sure that we have something that you both of them to to offer and also I wanted to reach out to Old camel apps maybe she would have been interested as well and I reached out to them way too late and I was I was riding too young Minsky the head of a chain Street and and his reply was why didn't you write us a little bit earlier so we can react him that and then he was like a replying again okay we will give you the like the catering sponsor and it's it's very uncomplicated very very nice I really love to Corporation with all our sponsors

  
 so in the end I mean I don't want you to share any private numbers here but I think it's interesting for people who might be listening and want to do something similar in their own area was this a profitable and nuff thing for you guys that it was worth your time I mean did you end up walking away with enough compensation that it was worth 120 hours you put in YouTube you personally for example or not-for-profit events and we also had to go that we raise some money so we can spend it on Open Source projects so this whole thing was planned to the be contributed back to the community park address because otherwise it wouldn't have worked if it's like a prophet's events of course it's a different way like it's just different how people approach to come from everyone was helping together everyone was contributing

  
 so what we did is we have some leftover money luckily and we are spending it on future things we wanted to talk about another thing because it's already getting my list

  
 wow that's awesome so this was all donation I mean in the sense that you guys just donated a lot of time to make this as a as a thing for the community to go to the community yeah and I'm way to go thank you yeah you're welcome I think that's the one thing I mean

  
 we we could just meet us over the last couple years and and I think I don't know we we we from recordings on one part obviously like I really enjoy cold and then especially Coating in French language and that's the very kristic reason why I do this like at the next 10 years I want to spend walking in and the time working functional programming languages I rather than hacking away before me to rotate the and organizing conference was its computer coding it was a little bit out of our comfort zone but on the other hand I think the impact for super valuable and if it work on an open source project I could have spent time in 20 hours working on on the open source project with reason and that would have been notified fun but I think in the end I feel comfortable that

  
 my name is Hannah plenty I was actually in organizing conference I do need for free what's a better investment for the future yeah yeah it's about community and Sons building building community that was important to us that's definitely a the skill of coding a lot because code is at the Coralville were doing but in order to support the code and support the community we also need people who are good at people skills to be able to put together and coordinate teaching and things like that so yeah definitely way to put your your skills to work for the good of the community

  
 yeah yeah I can actually see it some some numbers is it was more meat as not for profit which also some people like some people get stuff for free fast that was really helpful and I think that's all survivors imported to us to not switch it in between and select okay or we might have some money left and we take this money for ourselves. We can do a different story I don't know yet how we how we will approach it but basically we would like the total cost 27000 euros and their total income was 45 left

  
 we all agreed we rather than investment in and future Staffing reason and yeah

  
 that's great thanks for sharing that that's really helpful those numbers are not to hear it and if you want to organize conference like let's say you want to do reasoncon facial recent contact us I'm happy just being Patrick Andrea me and we can clean out the spreadsheet and animal sit and then share all the details like how much we spent on catering how much was spent on venue and then how much the tickets in Columbus so you can get to get a rough feeling for like for you what are you signing up for if you want to do it that's awesome that would actually be a great resource to do to put on that get have repo and that we need me or something like that have a great deal to me that's a good idea

  
 awesome okay so what's been there like a couple minutes we have left did you have any particular Lessons Learned you wanted to highlight from the experience

  
 Patrick anything comes to mind so the first thing we started out small and we didn't even plan for we didn't even plan to be honest because we didn't know how this will end up and Indiana to pit us because Sunday we needed the information who is vegetarian and what so always collecting information and Indians you have this information if you need it we we could schedule it somehow so we offered vegetarian food in the end for the conference day so it wasn't a big deal but these are just a small details you learn after you have done the mistake and I'm not sure if it's even possible to ride this on a list and people noticing it because you will do this around and you will never do it again

  
 where did ride a bike you can tell people how to do what you got to do your scent but I do see things that I've definitely going to get soap refill in one thing there's also so if you totally forgot this some people don't like to be on on photographs facial bones right so you can do different colors of land yard looks like one is for example I threaten want to stock rats and then if you see that on a picture that was taken by one of your photographs fotografos you can say okay this picture includes that person so we not going to show that picture and that's completely fine and that's how you respect the individual yeah that's a good one. And it's actually less than that of course it's like don't compromise I mean at some point I felt like today was really fast and then

  
 long time we sold almost nothing until tickets and if we got a little bit it's like all my God what do we do if we don't sell all the tickets yet so much cost now but yeah we may be fun about that go we have a meeting list let's send out to all these people buy a ticket now only so many left and something to be said together and agreed on like to know if I would get such an email if I would be annoyed he would be spam to me so we don't. That would create bad experience for the conference let's not do it we we can we can go for a lot of chance we can make it we can make it happen only by good experiences and yeah that's that was so taking care of details something really

  
 like reminding yourself like two things the team of the free like it was the first time for me working for Patrick and and Andre on when we do this meet-up spot this is an on another scale and then have to say thanks Patrick and Andre this worked really well the team is fantastic and second part is to communities fantastic because we got so much help from so many people balusters reading the place to to to execute in it

  
 love it that's great thank you Nick and eating out Patrick another group to calculate a lower and upper ball if your budget I think this helped a lot to keep saying in this whole mess because if you have an or Bond you saying okay in the first case we cut down on this on this cost I'm just catering whatever and you are still in the black numbers and biscuits a lot of confidence and it's always a balance of that keep keeping a balance of sanity and I'm feeling comfortable with with the money and keeping an overview over it together with having dessert with the right support us and community of course so if you plan to do this try to keep keep this Sunday but it's somewhere so you can always get up and down

  
 love it great tip so tell us a little bit about what you two are working on right now as we wrap up the show like what what are you doing not conference related but in your in your own reason or personal projects

  
 Sarah neck and Ice Project because of her nose architecture to integrate rebels in so they have support from many different languages like pipe and Julia are and whatnot and the couple that with my stalker infrastructure to every code sell your ride is physically mutable so you write some code it evaluated and then it catches the state of the darker image immutably and this is so it's just like magic working in this and it's so did they are hopefully going to lunch somewhere in September so people can open the exit and

  
 yeah and I learned so much about that weekend with compiler it's insane that some will learn someday how to elect stings and how to parse things and how to execute parse code and how the reason compatible or the reason powers are and how they all fit together it's less complex in a thought so it's it's manageable to Pebble into it and understand it's my lesson learned it is one one and a half weeks actually so I started from scratch in one of the half weeks I already got this kind of integrated so that's what's great

  
 wow that's awesome way to go that sounds super exciting I hope you let us know when the product is released so we can talk about it on the show and get people to go use it it's really cool cool I'm guessing phone one part at a job at 8 today is split between two things a couple of days per week I do like classic Consulting freelancing sweatshops but the other thing is like I recorded it courses because actually from this from this hackathons Shack sessions will and like it's real to get like I like the fact that like if you cross this is a real convenient and fast way to unblock people and so I did one accident at cat IO for reason just to get to know the language does nothing about like it's only about the the semantics

  
 I'm still planning to work on like you do something the cost for pocket script recent react also collecting some of like a advanced recent topics that the most interesting and yeah but that probably by the end of the year I should have like two free more courses discover reason and for once it's super fun for me on the other hand Alona Tal on going into this and I think I'm most proud of is like but tablet into I like preparing for the course if I have found the some some improvement I could make for for the recent dachshund to accept it that's pretty cool yeah that's great awesome

  
 is it going yeah we missed that one is like awesome yeah and then then also one thing that I care about and I saw your blog post for example recently is the story of my hobby project for the next month or two months I want to create the ready to go or production-ready set up we can have Cracker Barrel at cans with recent compact native I was focusing a lot on the universe Lando because that's what I worked within the last couple years a lot but maybe fargate this writing and yeah but see I just will play play around with it for the next couple months and 1 / set up that would be the coolest places in 5 minutes you should have something and in 5 minutes you should be ready to have a production ready set up with everything you need

  
 that would be awesome I've spend much much more than 5 minutes in the past couple weeks doing that same thing and thank you honey great develop experience but also like great experience from like 02 production that's a very convincing way of like choosing a technology

  
 have definitely but we're going to certainly look forward to both of those things I mean I'm sitting here going wow these guys are so cool glad I just get to talk to you so thank you for taking the time yeah thanks Patrick thank you very much for having us and I were going to say a big thanks to Andre as well even though he wasn't able to speak for himself here but I'm sure that the two of you covered what he would have said very well so thank you and until next time listeners thanks for tuning in by

  
 bye
