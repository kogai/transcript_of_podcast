  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 28th May 2nd 2018 to start things off this week let's talk of bit about some companies using rust so there are three companies that recently released a bit of their experience reports for using rust the first one called figment they do Graphics programming on the web kind of an interactive Graphics environment they talked about how a switch from a JavaScript a solution to A R Us pay solution actually had quite a big impact in terms of performance the next article is by rust user called century and I'll definitely link that in the description as well and the third one is called polysync so we see in self-driving cars in the past this is a another company that's based out of Ann Arbor Michigan that's working on self-driving car technology and one of the things they put out is an article describing

  
why they aren't doing some of that work and see but instead in Rust and to their mind how important trust is to their software it's a pretty cool read I'll also make sure to link that as well

  
 our next news item falls on the chain of some of these cool announcements by big names and software and Hardware beginning to use rust so I've heard about Facebook and some of their tools this week of the phone company Nakia is come out with their own but a software using rest it's called in perf which is a performance profiler I haven't had a chance to use this yet but I'll definitely link to it as I see any name that you know start to use rest I think it's totally cool to see some nice Hardware Ventura start to experiment with it so maybe one day and maybe one day soon we'll be able to walk into the store buy a phone and know that the software running on the phone as at least in part written in Rust

  
 hey you you in the back you're being really quiet I'm going to ask you a question where did you go to school and did it teach rust

  
 bad announcement this week at the University of Maryland College Park is starting to teach rust in its survey course I remember when I was going to school and they taught all the fundamentals of computer science and see by the time I left that actually had transferred from see over to Java and most of the what's the fundamental computer science courses were taught in Java maybe sometime in the future we'll see that some of the fundamental courses in the next generation of computer science curriculum will be taught and rust I mean how awesome would that be our next news item is about regular Expressions I know those of you who already know that this this bit of news as far as probably cheering in the back of your mind so they regex Crate by Burnt Sushi is it extremely popular crate on creyts i o I think it's been downloaded millions of times at this point lots of things depend on it or have dependencies that depend on it it's definitely

  
 fundamental crate in the ecosystem this week it hit 1.0 it's always good to see a major make it over the line to be 1.0 yes you that much more confidence that Rusty indeed maturing over time does you caring about compiler performance which I'm sure are 99% of you there's an article written recently about some recent performance improvements to the compiler each Improvement may only be a person or two but as you can imagine these tend to add up so when you get a good dozen of these the percentage actually becomes noticeable Nick nethercote has been working in the background on some of these compiler performance improvements and it's recently written a Blog talking about each of these performance improvements how much gain you was able to get and showing some of the benchmarks how they improved over that time

  
 and the last bit of news this week is the next in a very long gone long going is that it worth going

  
 nexo long ongoing saga non lexical lifetimes improving the bar Checker excetera the bar check her being that corner piece of the rust experience and a quarter piece of the rest compiler really does need that loving care so that it continues to evolve and improve Nico of course being one of the long-standing authors of the bar Checker and some of the technology there has been looking recently into how to improve it how about it like this in the description so you can read it for yourself it gets pretty little technical but it's a cool way of seeing kind of into Nico's thinking that's a great it's a great article and check out

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and as always keep on resting
