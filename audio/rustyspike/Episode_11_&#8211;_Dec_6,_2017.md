  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast on your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 11 December 6th 2017 some fun stuff in this episode let's go ahead and get started

  
 person is on him this week is about Stratus so Stratus is a new tool thing written by red hat for Fedora Stratus is a tool for working with the ZFS butter of the xfs file system on C early on some of the Lennox distributions dipping at Owen with rust and it's really cool to see them work on the next layer of tools used to the two little bit more serious a little bit more chords to the actual system is really encouraging to see red hat take that photo confidence in Rust

  
 the next bit of news this week it's around a company called buoyant went a startup that uses go and Rost for their products has released some of their first offer out into the open this project is called conduit it's a new open-source servicemesh for kubernetes not I will be the first to admit I am not the most well-versed in Cloud to Renee's and that whole Arena I will definitely put the link in the show notes so if you're interested you can definitely read more

  
 and of course you knew I had to sleep in a little bit of rest and webassembly news along the way so I got two for you this week one of them is a game called Rocket Rocket is a little experiment using wasm in the browser and it's kind of fun to play very simple space shooting game you can check it out the other bit of news is that go to the Russ playgrounds you can now output your web assembly for your R Us code

  
 the next bit of news is for you optimizers out there and I know there are plenty of you

  
 there is a new benchmarking Library called Criterion. RS so kryterion is a hostel based benchmarking Library this is the port of that to rust

  
 and it's and it's really to bring fuel kind of statistically significant micro benchmarking to rest

  
 it will go ahead and run your particular function or whatever the code as they are benchmarking he'll run it enough times that I can report the runtime with some confidence and then give you that interval it's pretty cool I'll go ahead and Link that in the show notes and you can check it out if you're interested in benchmarking

  
 this next bit of news is the almost but not quite 1.0 release of a well-known library in Ruston course that's the diesel Library the RM in query builder for rest a lot of people use this thing in a lot of people I'm sure but waiting for it to hit 1.0 so good luck y'all for thing that 1.0 and I'm sure they would love all the testing they can get so if you do use diesel I definitely heard you to go and download the newest one give it a run and let them know what you think

  
 you know we also got a bit of surprise this week and this next news item is something I'm not sure if any of us really expected that we had heard a little bit of whisper here and there with some of Facebook's experiments I'm not sure any of us really thought the material Source control system would move parts of its official code to rest and that is exactly what the current plan is

  
 titled of course the oxidation plan for mercurial this plan talks about how parts of the sea and python code can be Rewritten and rust they list a few reasons you're one of them being the startup overhead time but there's actually a lot of information in this oxidation plan for why they are considering making that move I also be sure to link that in the show notes so you can read more and the last two items this week are bit of thank you going out to the Firefox browser architecture group this group is kind of a think tank for how to do the browser better in the future I want to think they've been doing perhaps surprisingly is to look at how to use rust on different operating systems they put together some information and how to deploy Russ libraries on Android and iOS

  
 I'll link though so you can check them out there's really loud at detail there and I hope you can get some good use out of it and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
