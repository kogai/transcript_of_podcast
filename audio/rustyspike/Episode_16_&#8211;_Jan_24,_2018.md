  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 16 January 24th 2018 all right so let's get started

  
 our first news item is about parcel though so you could do some JavaScript programming may know JavaScript bundlers is our packages like webpack that help to group together your assets into one I can do series of steps help you deploy your project one of these new bundlers called parcel has not released their 1.5 release in there is this nice little nugget or they how to step compiling from rust to webassembly you just installed the rest compiler and it put that rest file in your package it was just that easy I really excited to actually be getting to make inroads as the language that you use to write webassembly

  
 our next news item is about funding open source work some of you may be familiar with Lil Baby it's a multimedia the library Mozilla is currently sponsoring the new version kind of an alternate version of Lil Baby called Rusty be at at the name hence it's a live AV written and rust it's cool to see Mozilla sponsoring these rust rewrites where it's really critical for performance are critical for security our next news item it's about Graphics so some of you who do a better graphics may already be familiar with Weber under which is a graphic system that's being currently built up to work in Firefox as kind of the next thing after the new style system in Firefox Quantum there's also Pathfinder which is a way of friend during fonts and SVG using your GPU there's a new project now called lion and lions are much more general purpose Vector rendering package that kind of sits in a similar Space 2

  
 Pathfinder and webrender and so if you do a bit of vector graphics in your applications you should definitely check it out it looks really cool and this next Tuesday I am I give a little bit of love this something that sadly probably just doesn't care as much as it should if you're listening and you work on redox OS good job y'all could job this week couple of things came out about redox what time is an interview with one of the main Craters of redox I'll be sure to link the interview in the show notes you can give that a listen it's really cool the other one is kind of a pack us come crash us so if you have a bit of a security bed the redox people watch you to pick it up and show them where some of the rough edges are here just because something is written and rust does it mean of course it's perfect in every way shape or form and that's especially true for systems-level software it still takes some work to get everything right so it's really cool to see them inviting people to the Yak come bang on it come show us where the problems are we'd love to

  
 does of your call may have heard of course. And I may have mentioned in this podcast that Mercurial has his rewrite of some of its python systems in to rest I'll link to an update of that where you can see they have been able to move some components from python to rust and they're starting to work on some of the major subsystems I didn't make sure I'll really has some users and Pockets I know but still use it I know Facebook use it to school to see a source control system like material get the rust treatment and in such a way that these big teams can begin using it and the last bit of news we have for this week is from hacker rank they did a survey over 39000 developer and ask them what are some of the languages that are most looking forward to riding in in the future affect what's the next one they hope to learn one-in-five developers in the survey said that Ross was the language they are excited about learning next I mean this kind of speaks for

  
 self we have more developers not just systems people but more General developers interested in Rust

  
 and that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and keep on resting
