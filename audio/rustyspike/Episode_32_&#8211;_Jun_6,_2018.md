  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 32 June 6th 2018 our first news item this week is another release of rice that's right a second Point release of the 1. 26 release this release 1. 26. Two addresses and unsound as fuck that made its way into the release this bug only affects 1.26 users and because of this the core team want to close it quickly so that others would be affected instead of electing to wait till 1.27 when they could fix it then I think that it was important enough to fix it and another Point release i-41 definitely think the release team of the core team for acting so quickly to make sure this is closed and at this fixed and as efficiently as possible this past week we had some pretty awesome stuff hailing from the Jazz County you conference of the name implies it's one of the big JavaScript conference from Europe this year's conference

are the rest compiler front we got a bit of news this week make that our code among others has again improved compiler performance another set of fixes went in of the last couple of weeks he wrote a blogpost called how to speed up the Russ compiler some more some more improvements all told the last few weeks of work improve the compiler performance in their Benchmark another 10 to 30% which is pretty awesome too kind of see all these improvements added together and really start to move the needle in terms of compile time performance this this next news item I thought was fun kind of out of left field I did not expect anyone to do this so you know we have crates. IO that's the main crate repository everyone knows and loves that works in Ross but someone decide to come up with their own Krantz repository is called crates. RS crates.
