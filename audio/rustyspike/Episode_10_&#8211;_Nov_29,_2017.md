  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 10 that's right we made it to double digits now November 29th 2017 all right let's get started so the first news item is a twofer we got to releases of R Us this past week the one. 22 and the 1. 22. 1 release this is basically the same release the point release fixes a problem in one of the recent versions of Mac OS that main feature in this release is to be able to use the? Operator with option I'll be sure to like the release notes in the show notes so you can learn more

  
try next news item support for rust on some new platforms so this week it was announced that risk 5 now has Russell Port Richey V is the new risk architecture that's currently being worked on at super cool to see rust already making head roads are really excited to see what they do with that next we have another update on the info. This is simple newsletter number for that's right we've already had for newsletters as part of the info. This year and in fact we still have another month to go so there's still plenty of work left to do and there's still plenty of momentum so if you're interested in contributing I definitely encourage you to jump in and check it out I'm just you know for this next news item I think I'm just going to link quite a lot of links in the show notes if you've been following the webassembly support and rust I mention this a few times in the podcast you seen that there's been a little bit of growing momentum there I personally saw a whole bunch of people on Twitter talking about using

  
Ruston webassembly together a couple of these in particular so there is a new plug-in for cargo for doing webassembly much more easily there's a great you starting guy that helps walk you through the process of setting up webassembly and doing your first application finally there's no support and browserify called Rasta fi this allows you to use browser if I to compile R Us to webassembly using the browser fight tool like at a whole bunch of cool things happening this past week and it's really encouraging to feel all the energy behind webassembly in Rusty's days if you're a fan of web development and Ross like myself I definitely heard you look through some of those links and see what people are working on

  
I got 2 news items for Server this week the first one is that the Android support for Firefox nickname fennec now has Stylo on by the fault so this isn't quite ready for prime time it's not in the shipping release version of Firefox but not it's on by default people that are testing finished going to be getting the style experience and it will ship in the Future 2 and I dare you the second piece of Servo news is a really cool right up by Bobby Holly Bobby is who helped had the Stylo efforts on the Firefox side so he saw how the transition of Stylo from being something on Servo to moving and being a full-blown piece of Firefox happened he run up that story and told the whole story in the end so you get to see a little bit of the early days of Servo and Ross and how they built Awards shipping in Firefox I like that in the show notes it's a really great read and that's it for this week thanks so much for listening thanks for being part of the 10

  
that's we've done so far and as always keep on resting
