  
episode is an interview with Jordan walk the original creator of react and one who started the project I think you be really interested to hear his thoughts on where it's going and also what you should consider if you are thinking of adopting reason yourself before we get started I like to thank Tyler. Com or been with sponsor which provide the linear core States approach to learning with technology question for you Jordan but first of all well I just asked how and why did we can get started so as a lot of people know I've always been a fan of the standard ml programming language open my eyes to have a programming language can influence the way you think about a problem and I can help you create better software that is more stable and faster and my eyes were open to this idea about the power of a programming language to shave how we think about things

  
and so I kind of started my my fascination with the ml family of languages and some of the original prototype of react were written in standard amount that I couldn't get past when I was using standard to melt implement the the react component model some static typing problems that I just I wasn't prepared to be able to solve those problems at the time but it also one of the reasons why those are difficult with me cuz I didn't have a lot of dead language Primitives go to the center now that okay well has to make some of these problems easier and I didn't know okay most the time but nevertheless being able to model the react component API

  
it is functional way using immutability help me to understand the problem of composing react components together in a way that is expressive so you know we end up writing react in JavaScript just because of the time JavaScript was a way that you would run anything off of wet but it wasn't really a great conversation story for taking standard mail and running it in the browser and even if there was it would be really hard to sell right this was back even before JavaScript Butler's have really taken off right most people just thought of JavaScript is this thing that you write in the you run it directly in the browser and the landscape for for programming UI on the web was totally different and it was very each team still in the ideas rendering in real programming language that wasn't really mainstream yet now

  
that you would do something like react so in order to receive a lot of attention to community has grown wild weeds the number of bundlers in Liverpool change the number of build systems compilers Satellite Systems late on top of JavaScript reevaluating the language itself that you're building on top of but in doing so in building up all of these tools that Target JavaScript as a compilation Target it's kind of reset the president the status quo now is that we're all using a compiled language to Target the web for using jsx compiler you are doing syntactic transform and that is required in order to run in the browser and always will be as far as I know

  
right yeah so now there's this in this more advanced landscape of of targeting web web browsers you think it's time to to bring in some more powerful languages around the start of 2016 one of the things I started doing was taking a look at some of the harder remaining problems and react in some of those were when we spend time Computing react rendering so it's not necessarily that react would be to sleep forever yusuke's we're doing a lot of the work is really inconvenient times so I started looking at concurrency which doesn't necessarily mean you know running things on multiple CPU cores but I just mean in early in the execution of tasks such a faker fear to be happening simultaneously even if they're not looking at how user interfaces could be done concurrently in a way that

  
this is really hard and it's in the react with fiber and so I was thinking really hard and I recalled back to when I was originally so I decided to send alert and to do so I picked up Campbell instead of standard and emerged ml description for me to understand the problem tomorrow all the edge cases in Ocala was helpful in catching all the corner cases that I hadn't thought about yet

  
chuckery no Campbell covered in case more than once even though it may not be a parent or a case for tomorrow in getting to the bottom of this and when I take this work and I will go show it to people I would see this kind of blank look on their face because it to them when they were seen when I was reading it just look like an expert reception thing I realized that when I was writing okay I'm bored in my mind

  
language okay but when other people see the code on the screen keyboard shaped by their their introduction to programming of the set of tools that they already know that's not wrong it's just what we have to work with so I realized that I can get a lot of people to more easily understand the idea that I was putting forth the code if I could just prove it would be more familiar and so that's when I started this. Of the grammar that was more JavaScript like any other developers inside a Facebook and and outside of Facebook to help out with that and ship natural product with it start building our ecosystem with react support and we started collaborating with buckles script and and Bob from bucklescript to Target in the browser in a way that the outfit looks idiomatic and reader

  
project sings the song of all those parts was a really compelling that for people who had existing products and that includes Facebook but also all of the other companies that are also using reason I love that one of the main instigators was this recognition that people come from different backgrounds and they're there are surface little changes you can make to to make this language so much more accessible and I think that principle has really played out and how the reason ecosystems develop and sometimes it's it's small engine if you think that people wouldn't be influenced significantly by syntax be surprised if the people are influenced by

  
kind of whether or not you should know about the stuff we have the right to dive in a little more to what you said near the beginning that using standard amount and Oak Hammock gives you tools to to think about problems better that's why things that I love about using a language-rich well-developed type system and what one of the things that I miss when I when I'm running a JavaScript could you dive in more maybe are there an example to come to mind of a a problem where it with the tools that were able to represent you better think about it better one of them just the small affordances given to doing the

  
grease complex things and it's easier it's difficult to mutate something you have to create this reference cell and that sounds like a downside but actually when the language the grammar and everything about it is just encouraging you to not do things kind of the default programs are less complex and they would be if you had to go out of your way to make something people write the other thing that that is really helpful about this language with two types is that it's so that means when you consume a library you have a really high degree of confidence that is correct and then it types it the types of cement are also correct and that is compiled

  
I'm here you can just delete that from your brains on constant background energy but you at least get to remove that whole other set of concerns for your mental energy so some people ask a lot when they come into the reason chat room or on Twitter they say this looks really cool is it ready yet can I use it so I guess I would I would phrase the question is how ready is reason or what are the what the cost currently the people should take into account when they're evaluating it so it is being used by Facebook and other companies that you can see on the reason about website I would say there's a certain kind of project that would most benefit for reason

  
for the stage of their product they don't really care about accuracy or they don't care about quality because they're just in a very quick and it's they're not even sure if it's going to work out now after you do get used to using reason and no camel and amount you actually can be more productive if you were to start something when you're just learning this Friday and you're already day behind don't use a new technology right now there's a time to invest in that kind of stuff and it's not always interested in thinking about problems differently

  
place where where they're ready you don't want to impose new technologies on your team when they're not supportive of it especially if you're not planning on sticking around sure you don't want to regardless of what it is typescript or flow or Reason and then just dropping you were taking the the responsibility of being the person who's in charge of this new adoption in your team you want to make sure that you stick around long enough to see it through and that you're that you own that and educate the rest of the team on this new technology totally so you mentioned that within Facebook there are there are teams adopting it and using it in production how how hard is it to sell reason within Facebook or what what's some advice you could give maybe some of our listeners who want to convince their co-workers or their boss that this is a good idea post about that we're good blogger something about you know how to convince your your your boss but in my experience

  
we have a really necessarily needed to do a lot of too busy a lot of people are coming to use it and we just tell people that we don't have the you know we may not have the capacity to ensure that your experience and getting on board it is absolutely great and so sure at this point we have to tell people that we can't help them right now and I know once we get some things work out then we'll be able to automate some of the setup and then it'll be a lot smoother for you to onboard so I don't know if it is a large company with a lot of people and a lot of people who experience various programming languages so it's not the same as another company out there and who aren't they're not in a meeting or technology they're consuming technology in the rating on a separate product right so it's totally different and I don't have a ton of great advice for that scenario but there are people like Facebook and all of the companies listed on the reason website that are using in production

  
production have been for decades and it's it's a battle-tested language that use in the financial industry is very mature it doesn't change it doesn't thrash you a lot so it's incredibly stable there are some parts of the reason to will check with her later eating rapidly we had a really large upgrade for the latest attacks and I went pretty smoothly Chamblee was awesome and helping the community automate their migration forward and the reason I have a couple of changes to move a little faster on the reason side then they do on the underlined language that people can have confidence that the underlying technology has been hurting for a decade or more and that it is being used by Facebook including things built by financial industry and really all of Facebook's core Technologies except react

  
camel pack flow in Furs also built on O'Connell so there's a lot of attention seems to be a lot of really good results infrastructure that scales really well yeah that's a great point and I think about when comparing reason to flow or typescript for example we're both of those have the temp system is changing frequently can cause a lot of Maintenance turn wear with with reason you're the confidence that this this is been around for awhile and it's battle-tested a lot about I don't mind getting thrashed but I really just want to get stuff done so that I wasn't even aware of it

  
speaking of changes but what do you see in the near future for reason generate flow types compiled reason project the user experience and I'm going for here and that we're striving for is you write your application your reason react app for example and you don't really necessarily think about the fact that you will be interfacing with the with an existing flowtype structured program you might function as with a very simple tag that just says export this thing to JavaScript for flow and as a result it will automatically types of respected on one side respected on the other end

  
she will also perform that for you so you don't have to write anything because we are getting the type system to drive all of this we have really high for trusted types from the in this case that's really promising. Sounds like it'll it'll just really lowered the any insecurities that there is when jumping over between JavaScript and Reason by introducing a reason react component into that high performance statically typed safe minimizing old the bugs at runtime

  
I'm working right now you don't have to because we automatically will generate the corresponding flow types yeah that's awesome looking into the future do you have any Pie in the Sky dreams for reason like what would success look like as a language or community community could take some of the work that we're better typing right now with this automatic float igeneration JavaScript type systems and how to integrate with any of that because right now they have to decide a front great if you could just write your library in the saddle reason language and then run the stool and have your library be exposed to all the different variants of JavaScript static typing

  
type definitions because that we use in Furs all of it totally so that would be ideal gas relief products is the path to success so what happens next at what when people have immigrated into the existing apps it's going to be a buckle skirt is also been so helpful for the Facebook and open source because it makes it really easy to incrementally adopt just one part of your app you can rewrite it and you don't have to write the whole thing all at once and integrates with what is in everybody's hands I think that there's something really powerful is it really parent people just learn a new language Incorporated it it's kind of its normal now

  
because you're actually learning o camel and you're actually getting access to all the benefits it'll camel has your program executable something that starts at faster in JavaScript if people have this new ability I want to see what the community can do to take this to take all of the developer tools that we development react and I want to take him to the next level by compiling them ahead of time if your native programs gotcha so so all these CLI tools that we use analysis lenting building bundling sometimes take you know multiple seconds on on a normal size diaper a lot longer than that on really big ones and and just get the native compilation benefit from reason

  
static and if that's what they're open source Technologies Campbell slow and half and it does this really well but does he evolve the developer to go native so that people can stop being pause on the command line while they wait for some people to run because I can happen often you know three times as fast internally over today to reason we saw a huge speedups over five times as fast but a lot of the week was important but still the fact that you can instantly started one of these binary executables is really powerful because it means that you can

  
die fast and then you one thing with without having to run these demons that it's been the background and how to request and you have the baby and have some water that killed the ones it's just a long time and I want to see people really fast and then I wanted to die and then that's it and I don't want to have to wait 200 milliseconds for this started because I write yeah I think of any unsolved problems in the reason language or Community or ecosystem that that we haven't talked about yet that you would really like to see salt or maybe that you've seen salt in other languages that we can work on adopting yes there's a couple of things that I just want to

  
how to organize many contacts I want to be able to spit out with bubble script but I'm incorporating tight skirts app I want to be able to run that negatively and then I want to I want to capitalize on that need a better start my program your writing this one abstract language I want to see this I want to see reason apply to these other domain but I want to see reason incorporated into something like where you can write your application compiled it into a really fast program and have it instantiate native use without any job you really awesome if you could just write in this one eyed shark language and have a football all the developer natively browser

  
when you want to build could be the one language in the first step is just to get it into developers hand so that it's a normal thing people want to write their ass and reason because they like the field without with reason react it's a more productive to more productive tool chain for me people so they're not even using it right now because they want to get all these other benefits of riding ones in the be able to run and all these different contacts yeah but then it's if this is already established all these other cool things is just so natural and helping out with some of the way to get involved and it's something that we should come together on in and write a road not that explores all the different options and and see

  
how to get started so that we can work towards that and the other thing is package Management in making strides towards with the EZ package manager the goal of easy is to allow you to integrate native modules from opium or anywhere else or even dated model for MTN Network Flow Bridges pack is Jay's on base where you pull another dependencies on empty and models and you can you can find all these things in order to build a web app or even share with people so this is something else that is it's really hard there's a lot of moving pieces has been has been developing some really impressive Milestones okay so so things that were still trying to solve or the the native compilation piece or or being a little

  
Target many different things and there's a community call out for if you're interested in react native infrastructure I guess talk to Jordan any any other on South problems for the route and they require a lot of community involvement in order to get there there's a lot of other cool tools that I'm not even thinking about that people surprising with all the time on the Discord channel is a room in a Discord Channel called look what I built and you can go there and you can share something to eat even if it's your first thing really welcome yeah I'll do that alright well are there are there any Community project you like to highlight or any last thoughts you'd like to share one thing I want to do the project that I'm working on that I mentioned earlier was starting in reason and you just want to add or once a sport that module

  
to flow reasonably type is doing the opposite direction which is also really valuable it's where you have an existing slow typer type script from a generator from flow into bucklescript able to go check that out and help out that project collaborate and contribute to it and of course I want me to take it to Key collaborator to our community and so everybody's everybody's aware of it but I just wanted to give a special call out to it because it's been very helpful mindful of the amount of bikes that were added to the developer and helping us

  
awesome one thing I like to call out that showed up and I look what I built Channel recently was a a JavaScript to reason translator that I think looks at the runtime representation of java projects to to generate bindings it's a cool project a lot of Link in the show notes help out with that project that would be really great because I can see if he is taking an existing Javascript app you have and then running this tool on it and it converts it into a reason a reason file so would that allows you to do is wrap compilation and get one of these Jazz built

  
all those benefits of awesome well this is been a very interesting episode of enjoyed learning about the roots of reason and really a lot of the selling points of using a stronger mature well typed language thank you so much for being on the show Jordan thank you okay and we'll see y'all next time
