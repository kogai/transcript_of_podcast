  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 18 February 7th 2018

  
 our first news item let's talk about jobs one of the things we heard in the rough survey was seeing Frost in more and more companies recently read it posted on the rust subreddit asking for a senior Russ programmer to apply it looks like Reddit is actually looking to soup up their belly to use Ross inside of right it itself so that's super cool and I hope they find some really good candidates if you think you're one of those I'll leave the link in the description so you can find out more for a second and third news-item pull up a chair get comfortable relax for my dulcet tones I will reach you word by word the new white paper and the new paper published about rust just kidding I'll leave those links in the description as well the first of these two papers is a white paper talking about the company tell them and how they moved from java to rust the white papers extremely well-written because I think it really gives a good

  
 concise view into a scene R Us in the real world the second paper is about the foundations of rust there's been some ongoing academic work on Rust and specifically the safety guarantees of the Russ language the name of the paper is called rustbelt securing the foundations of the rust programming language combined both of these papers of course Target different audiences but I think tell a similar story so I'm excited to see more academic papers come out about rust as well as more of these white papers about why using rust in your company could be good for your company and our next news item let's talk about conferences again so we've actually already had our first conference this year if you can believe it or not cause them which is open source conference had a restroom this year. Restroom was packed with a long line out the door

  
 that in itself is pretty awesome people post on Twitter pictures of how long the line was and how long they had to wait in line to become part of this restroom once inside they're treated to a number of talks about rust from people using rust in the wild I'll link of the notes the videos so you can watch for yourself I got to say it's pretty cool though that they're not much interest at Fallston for rust

  
 how to throw one more little announcement in the batch so if you fuse quick time before you may have heard of h.264 this is the video Codec that the the meat of actually encoding and decoding video Mozilla and a number companies have been working on a new video Codec call Davy 1 Apple just recently joined everyone making everyone a very strong considered to be the next Kodak that's used in videos Around The World from popular websites like twitch and YouTube and many more and their recent hack week they put together a new video encoder 481 called the rust av1 encoder Godly enough I'll link to that if you're at all interested I think it's so cool to be able to see some of the future of where video is going and it's really cool to be able to help with it in the ground floor showing what's possible with rust in this new media format and with that we are right for this week thanks
