  
hello everyone and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 12 December 13th 2017

  
 this episode is going to be very very short so let's go ahead and dive in

  
 our first news item is a continuation of a news item that we talked about and a previous episode some of you may remember that we talked about the visual studio plugin that supported the language server protocol this is the standard protocol that Visual Studio code created and more IDE started to support it Microsoft Visual Studio was one of the last ideas that had yet to support it and reported recently that they had out of support for that

  
 unfortunately there's a little bit more to get the wrestling with server up and running then to just turn on the language server protocol and this is where the news item comes in this week I'm happy to announce that one of Microsoft own developers has created the rust language server support for visual studio built on the language server protocol it's still very early and he's encouraging people to pick it up and give feedback I'll definitely leave the link in the description one thing to note if you are a user of this you will need the most up-to-date version of visual studio in fact at the preview build a visual studio I'll be sure to link the preview build as well as some of the instructions so you make sure that you can get going

  
 the sex was kind of a fun social media experiment that's being created by the publication propublica so what they've created is a Facebook political ad collector this is something that you can run inside of Firefox and chrome it's written rust and its job is to a liar to the note if an ad in Facebook is political or not they'll be using this to classify and understand how political ads work in Facebook better in the future it's kind of cool experiment I'll go ahead and make it so you can try it out for yourself

  
 and we're almost to the end there's just one last one I wanted to call out this week in fact it's it's kind of a heartwarming line for those of us who been working on rest for a while as many of you know Mozilla fun trust development for any organization especially when is largest Mozilla a new programming language takes a long time to really get its roots and to really build a fanbase large enough to start moving coat over as many of you saw with Firefox Quantum we saw the first big chunk of rest are to land in Firefox this week at the most of all hands we got a nice shout-out for all the work that we've been able to do in Roston Servo in these last few years it's really encouraging to hear these kind of shout-outs I'm looking forward to what muzzle I can do in the coming year

  
 like I said really short and sweet this week as always thanks for listening and keep on rusting
