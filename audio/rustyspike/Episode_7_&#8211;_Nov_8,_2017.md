  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Sarah News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 7 November 8th 2017 so let's go ahead and get started our first news item this week it's about rewriting it in Rust well not exactly rewriting it addressed this is the name of assignment in Stanford's new programming language course curriculum Stanford is now included R Us this part of their programming language survey course now it's just one assignment and it larger course but it's really encouraging to see Stanford seal of approval of rest and we really hope to see more universities pick up rust and use it in their curriculum

  
her next news item it's about the rest core team

  
 for some of you who views read it before you may have heard the term Ama or ask me anything for the last week the rest core team has done an AMA open up to anyone asking them questions about Russ and of course there's lots of ones that we've seen many times like how would you compare R Us in C plus plus but there's actually a lot of questions and a lot of really good feedback from the rest core TM so I called you to check it out this next item is probably a common question for lot of you could use rust in there I D E Nick Cameron who leads the dev tools team write a post called when will the RLS be released now some of you may be curious because then I just have that in one of the previous episodes about the are less being released that is RLS and the rustling our server is available as part of the stable release of rust when you install it it's RLS - preview the kind of horny that this isn't quite complete even though you can get it in the stable release Nick details in this blog

  
 there's still more features and capabilities that he wants to make sure I'm place before it hits a 1.0 I don't want to tell you when that is going to be I'll let you read the blog post to find out more

  
 here's a fun fact that I may have mentioned something similar on the podcast before

  
 so I looked this morning to see how R Us was growing nice you look to see how breast is growing a year ago you take rights. I know is growing in a nice steady clip something around 10 new crates every day this morning went and looked at the package growth of crates i o i noticed that we are now up to 21 new crates every day and that's super cool

  
 a bit of Servo news now this is may be jumping the gun just a little bit but I was looking at the park west coming in for a server when I noticed that very soon perhaps when you hear this podcast that Servo will have some of his first capabilities of being able to play back audio

  
 now there's a couple more steps that need to land before you can just open up a web page and click on audio and can play it but it's really encouraging to see just how much is being done and how much can be shared between Gecko and servo

  
 and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
