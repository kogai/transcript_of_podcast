  
hello and welcome to Reading Town podcast about reason I'm asking you to the next to awesome I'm super excited to have avocado here with us who is the managing director of the hottest Foundation she just gave a talk at reasoncon about developing a community that is inclusive and diverse and I'm really sad to talk to her about these topics welcome love. For having me to start out how you doing so I I first got into Cody when I was 11 or 12 I talked a little bit about this in my talk at reason, and basically I just happened to find out about HTML and CSS and sort of building small websites from scratch

  
and that's basically how I got started and then I left that aside for a few years and then accidentally sort of got back into coding after attending a real skills Workshop Gary Indiana tight end of the workshop got really excited about building stuff again and then started learning Ruby earlier with various people stories and polygons and can inform the way that we should a community could you give us up at

  
so my talk I'd reason conf was specifically aimed at a community that is hurting you because I know that the best way to make a community diverse is to think about it from the start and so I think the reason Community is at this really great moment in time where nbc30 simple to ya to make the communities diverse and so that was sort of my goal with the talk was to give tips and ideas on how we can think about diversity and inclusion ability in a fairly new community and the first part of the talk was a lot about sort of setting the foundation for understanding where did I put the person who comes from Intech giving a little bit of an idea of what the current landscape looks like in Tekken

  
and in the open doors Community more in detail and then I talk to a lot about privilege and bias which to be honest I was a little worried about how it would be received because I found myself standing in a room mostly full of men and yeah I really wasn't sure how that was going to go yeah but I think that's pretty much what I covered in the talk

  
awesome I came up quite well actually delivered to a room

  
 so what one thing we were talking about earlier is how they're the reason Community is

  
 play small as you said still growing and the way that it is from so far is mostly the people who started it inviting my friends talking to people they already know and maybe some people in inverted countries come across it and then inviting their friends and that kind of set us up for an 84 if you mostly invite your friends your friends are probably people that look like you and so you end up with community that is mostly men so far what are what are tactics food intake to I mean it would also be great to have a good diversity in our friend group but aside from that how can we make sure that the reason being if he doesn't end up with people that all look the same

  
 I often just recommended so I use Twitter a lot I love Twitter I think it's a great tool to hear different voices and to just kind of y'all to get to know people you wouldn't otherwise get to know sort of in your local community right and so I've been using Twitter loves to basically try and find people who are not like me and basically trying to build a network of different people so I think that's perhaps a very good way to start it just basically just following different people on Twitter and there's by now and there's people who have created lists of you know women in Tech women in JavaScript people of color in open sores and there is there's various lists and very often if you follow like a couple

  
 trick of big players in certain communities it makes it much much simpler to kind of. I think that's if I had to give like one single thing to do that would be the one that expanding the network through tools like Twitter and maybe maybe you can you can point us to some of those lips and we'll put in the show notes for people that are interested to look the same we we need to make sure that it is a place that's everyone can be comfortable if we invite all of these people from different walks of life so that we can have a community that is diverse how do we make sure that that they feel comfortable there

  
 that's another very good question a lot of the times when we talk about diversity and inclusion we focus on diversity and forget the inclusion price it's really important to you to actually builds the community or to set up the community in a way that the people who are invited there or brought in don't feel don't feel unwelcome or uncomfortable it's actually hard to headache I feel like it's easier to do the whole diversity bit that it is to the whole inclusion bed because again like it requires for us to look at our own biases and our privilege and to sort of think okay I feel comfortable into space why do I feel comfortable in this space are there things that I can think about that could be done differently in order for other people that aren't like me to feel comfortable

  
 I think so I think again like the first step to inclusion is to listen to what people have to say so if someone comes into a space and says okay I feel uncomfortable here because of this end this then listening to them and sort of taking they're using their feedback and making changes is sort of a really good step however of course this requires for people to speak up which means that you put a lot of their workload on them and it shouldn't be that way so

  
 need to think about it for a minute I was about the reading community and our forums and chat rooms is I think we're very welcoming to newcomers people that don't have any fun summer drinks perience or very little or people that are even quite new to programming and Kira talks and her talk about ways that we could be even more welcoming to to newcomers and people that don't have the experience

  
 but I also want to make sure that that translates to people that are newcomers that also are white men so I mean I think in type generally we do sometimes have issues with thinking about people who are a newcomers and that often I think often the issue is just that if you are 5-10 years into your programming carrier you sort of forgot what it was like to start out and that's why I also think and you as a certain person who works in education can totally understand that it's like I think sometimes the best teachers are those very new people because they still remember what it was like to start out and until I think

  
 again Gathering feedback and talking or including the newcomers in making those decisions like how do we make a space safe for comfortable for newcomers is you know what is great and that's what I loved about your us talk because she just sort of went into how can we make things better and this is my point of view from someone who started out a little over a year ago and yeah but to get back to search of the the diversity and inclusion topic I think there's just sort of Fairly basic things that by now are required in communities that make them safer and more comfortable for 4 people for all kinds of people and

  
 one of them and this is something that I also talked about him I talked yesterday was the code of conduct and I think by now we're in a place where most people understand that you need to have or that you should have a code of conduct but I think not everyone understands yet why you need to cut of conduct and what the code of conduct should look like so I'm the assumption that everyone in the community is a nice person is great but I think it's not enough to to make the community safe for everyone and so having a code of conduct that's extremely detailed that explains you know what is behavior that we don't accept entered of really going to detail and what are the consequences for for this type of behavior I think that kind of makes it much easier to

  
 deal Dan with with issues in the community and I think Young on one of my slides and we can put this in the show notes as well and I had a really good resource from Ash Dryden she basically collected a bunch of information about, but if it was I think it's titled code of conduct 21 or something and it's really a really good look at the house the Y and of cocs

  
 I recently saw a cold, I think imma runs project that had near the end it was like you are some example interactions like in a chat room where in a lemon and here's the interaction where somebody says uses able to sign language that would denigrates non-radical people and there was no response on the person said oh sorry I was going to again and then there's another example of somebody that kind of needed a little bit more intervention to to help them out and I thought that was really cool

  
 no I mostly care about code of conduct in the context of a conference that says if you have any problems, how does that work in the context of a large community how does enforcement typically work or

  
 saying if you have a problem go here with the pre-match so I mean of course you have to decide and you know what they think is appropriate as supportive and I don't want to use the word punishment but as every Community needs to look at how they want to deal with the consequences the first good step is to have a certain number of people dedicated people who are in charge of handing handling code of conduct violations and again it's always really good if these people are not just the same type of people because

  
 very often under-represented people or marginalized people tend to not be believed when it comes to when it comes to situations like Katakana violations and so it's good to have I think a person that you know you can really trust where you can go and say this was like a microaggression and I know that may be a white straight white man might not understand what this feels like but I know that you're like me and you've probably witnessed something like that right steering something like that and I know that you will believe me or understand like how deep microaggressions can go so I think I can relate much better too I think that's really important and then of course within a community particular

  
 an online community it's a little harder because you don't have sort of the physical you can talk about things face-to-face and I think as we move more and more into online communities

  
 I have the feeling that text-based communication is sometimes misunderstood so much more than a night perhaps it's because we don't have the the sort of physical feedback the body language or anything like that but it feels like we've sort of falling back on using emojis to express if we were being sarcastic or not and so I can understand that it can be really hard to handle code of conduct violations within the context of an online community but I guess we just have to learn how it soon and how to make it work okay for you were talking about inclusion was

  
 having a community survey I know MGM recent around a large survey about all the jobs for community and get Hub U of U Reckless the open-source survey in your talk and having a survey that synonymous might also be a way that we could look for one collect information on demographics in interesting things about people experience learning reason but also feedback on is there anything we can do to make it more welcoming or are there idea that people to make this just a better community so I think surveys are definitely a very good way to give and get back what's always interesting and I I mean I love looking into surveys and trying to use that as beta for for my dogs and two to make points

  
 it's and I'm not like I'm not a data scientist or I don't I don't do that for a living and I'm not skills and sort of understanding how to phrase question answer that people will answer better but I think we also always have to be careful with basically who answers the surveys like is it going to be rain 100% of the community if not who are the people who are not you know who are not answering are they actually the people that we want to reach and so also with the Open start with the GitHub opens her survey survey I mean I don't remember ever feeling out the GitHub opens her survey so this means that I'm not included in these responses and an independent results right so it's definitely a good way to get feedback it's definitely a good way to have an idea of the demographics but it's also

  
 but I'm not sure like how to do it best so that you get as much information from that as possible and there's a portion of population that is much less representative if if there's a little sample exactly unfortunately my wife has study sociology and social working so she knows how to create survey in the right way and do the dinner now so it would make that yeah cuz I mean there's a whole sort of Science and behind how to phrase things so that people will be more likely to answer them and I think there's also been I think there's also going to research into the bias of like how you phrase questions and how you basically set up answers to

  
 people will actually answer what you want them to Enter Prince his also like it sort of science or skill in itself yeah

  
 I also want to talk about reels girls summer of code and you said that you getting into programming again was through a real turtles meet up is that right and now you're trying to program can you tell us about how it works and how members of the region Community can't get involved both if they want to participate or if they want to donate or organize or whatever it is so I want to go a little bit into Church of the history or the background of real skulls and how it came about It To Em basically railscales is assertive decentralized initiative where people can host workshops in their own City and heard of set up a group they're usually the workshops her today workshops would like an installed party where you install Ruby and everything and then a workshop on the following day and

  
 this is yeah this is a decentralized initiative which means that people set up the groups and people attend whatever I attended the one in Vienna and the communities at the time when of the Roosevelts communities at the time that was very very strong was the Berlin one so rails goals originated in Finland and was created by a woman called Linda Lucas who now does a lot actually in education and in teaching kids how to code a using Ruby and writing books but yeah the Berlin Community actively grew a lot and so the rails goes chapter sort of I think by now it's one of the biggest or if not the biggest in in the world because the workshops happen super off then like I mean Super often twice a year or so and so the Berlin Community said okay after the workshops and these are beginner

  
 pork chops what how do we you know how do people continue coding and so they set up study groups and then after the study groups they sort of wondered okay you know what could what could go next if their goal is to find a to start a career as a programmer will the study group be enough or what should come next and so from from. Came the idea of starting a summer of code similar to the Google summer of code where people can basically just sort of dive into code by country butane to open source software for 3 months so this is sort of how it got started right now I think it's very confusing for people because rails goals and rails go summer of code or sort of different or separate initiatives in the sense that the people organizing the rails goes events in the people organizing girls go summer of code is four separate separated but to get back to Roseville summer of code

  
 the 3-month program for women and non-binary people all around the world with no restrictions on age or on background I'm so Google summer of code for example is I think only for University students we don't have that requirement because we want a different audience we want different people literally people from all walks of life we've had people who were 18 people who were 50 years old and we've had women who sort of got back into text like after 20 years not working in the industry so it's all the little a little different from from regular summer of code programs but they contribute to open source full-time and are paid for it so that sort of the general the general idea and again the name is very confusing for people because it's not just rails it snow

  
 just Ruby we have projects from different communities different languages so the program is actually language-agnostic and we've had you know projects like Servo which is a breast or nextcloud which I think is PHP and so lots of different we've had Babel as well which is Javascript to so many different different project and then and so actually one way in which the reason Community could get involved would be by submitting reason as a projects for people to work on so that could I could really imagine that happening next year for example project saying I would love some help with this if there are any more tears

  
 a lot of that matching so we basically when when applicants apply to the program we provide them with a list of projects to work on and when I say project I mean I would consider reason to be a project and Knots not to know specific feature that needs to be implemented as being counted as a project that makes sense and so usually project maintainers will come to us and say or will submit their project and say I want to participate in Roscoe summer of code these are some of the things that I Envision for the future that that participants could work on and we basically do it the other way around so we we have maintainers come to us we decide which projects which sort of consider having on board then applicants apply to the program basic

  
 that's one of the projects I'm talk to the maintainers to figure out if they'd be a good fit and then we basically pull all of that information together and then do the selection that way awesome and how does how does mentorship work like what what are the expectations of so if for example reason were submitted the project is it expected that the reason we would then also provide mentorship for the Pistons or will they find you some other night or how does that we have two different roles in the program and we need to think a little bit perhaps about like naming them better but we have the mentor roll soda project Mentor roll and then we have the coach roll usually maintainers of say did the reason project wood would focus on helping participants sort of stay on track when it comes to

  
 the features that they want to develop so they wouldn't help necessarily with technical with questions like with questions like oh you know my code isn't working and I don't know how to debug this but this would be the role of the coaches that the team have have chosen until they find their own coaches either in the local community or remotes coaches and these people will help them at the technical at the more basic technical level whereas the project maintainers of saved the reason project would guide them a little bit when it comes to developing the features thinking about the roadmap you know reviewing the code and all that so yeah I guess the responsibility split between the project maintainers and the coaches that the team have chosen

  
 Burger King four past 10 and more details me back a little bit more but not not helping the day today like my belt is broken yeah I'm not take that they would perhaps you know do a call once in awhile or sort of a meeting to talk about you know what comes next and and things like that but yeah most of like the day-to-day work is then assigned to coaches in the end this program where does you said that you said that for these three months the participant is also paid for their contribution where does that he would come from just leave just a public meeting her organize the funds for that I'm so we are going to use all of the funds for for that and we run every year we do

  
 a fundraiser we basically the money comes from party from from sponsors that we have you know either sponsors we have every year like GitHub is one of our biggest Partners since the very beginning and some of the donations just come from the community so yeah so it's kind of late but we organize the money and we try and kind of handle as much of D organizational side of things so that people don't have to worry about you know Finding mentors finding money and all that

  
 well that sounds really cool I I think we'll throw some of code could be something that we could respect this as a reason community and maybe through that support under representative

  
 I think we covered all of the topics that I was excited to discuss are there any last words of advice or other other projects that are helping with diversity passivity that you want to do a shout out to there's so many there's so many so one thing perhaps when person project community that I also really really love and would specifically like to find people to is

  
 Dakota newbies Community they are a community of also incredibly diverse people from different places at horde learning to code together the organizer or the person who created that Community is Sirhan need brake and she also is the organizer of the code land conference that I attended in New York last week and that's just an awesome Community to sort of look up to to ya to be a part of so if any of your listeners are newer to programming and and or needs some support from a programming from another Community then I would I would suggest that they going up there and that they've definitely just also check out the code and Conference which might happen again next year because it was amazing

  
 yeah they set the bar really high as far as conference's go otherwise I think I mentioned Ash ashes work earlier there's a resource that I find incredibly helpful called model view culture it's an online magazine unfortunately it's the funk now but all of the articles are still online and they can be read that and it should really read a great resource to help people through the topics of the a privilege intersectionality feminism and hurt of a critical look at Tech so that's also a really really great resource that I love and

  
 I'm or the people behind model of your culture also run a program called Fun Club the idea of fun Club is put your money where your mouth is and so if you have money to spare every month they basically choose a an Initiative for you to donate to so you sign up and what you get is like every month and initiative that you should sign up to and I think that's great because if you're basically if you have the means to donate but don't really know which which initiatives are interesting or which ones need your help financially then that's basically it really like lazy way to to handle that and through that you actually get to know another like the smaller initiatives that you don't really hear about it otherwise so yeah definitely I think those would be

  
 find the club fun Club yes thank you so much for coming out and somehow and for speaking at a conference committee yeah thank you so much for having none to podcasts it was exciting to be at a conference until you too many new people so yeah I'm really looking forward to seeing what the reason Community what it develops into
