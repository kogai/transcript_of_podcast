  
hello welcome to the receipt spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 30 May 23rd 2018 our first news item this week is around compile times recently the compilers actually seen a fair amount of the improvements and mention a few and previous podcast this week we had another set of improvements and more on the way I link to a blog post talking about some of those improvements and some cases there quiet pressive the other better compiler performance news is that Aaron's Ron is asking people about projects that are taking too long to compile he is compiling these projects

  
and from that hopes and credit collection of these slow to compile projects so that the compiler team can methodically go through them and make the optimizations necessary

  
 Ardex bit of news is around the Rust book that's right it's the rust programming language 2nd edition is now on its way to the presses I don't have a date yet on when it's expected hit shelves I know it's been a long time coming so it's really awesome to see the book making such progress and I'm really looking forward to having it in my hot little hands

  
 play next news item are for fans of logic programming well anyone really who uses the rest compilers likely to benefit from this work all these experiments may not necessarily bring fruit for the 2018 Edition currently they're expected to land just after that the experiments that nikomat sakis of the compiler team are doing with Frank mcsherry a researcher and logic programming are really interesting and they have created a series of blog posts a kind of conversation around how to improve the bar with checkered using logic programming and using some of these new techniques of course link to a blog post talking about this if you're at all interested and optimizing the bar Tucker or house on the techniques of the bar Checker or getting in coded as logic programming Primitives I definitely check it out it's some really cool stuff

  
 are you jetbrains fans out there I've been a jet Branch news for you they have updated their sea lion R Us plug in with some new features I'll definitely link to the release notes so you can check those out and for those going to Russ, and those including myself who I force I can't make it likely but will love to watch those videos there's more information about the back to schedule for us, including a killer looking closing keynote said the closing keynote for Russ, this year is by Catherine West and while that may may not be very familiar to all the listeners I'm sure they work definitely is we talked about it before on the podcast that chucklefish video game programmer has been creating a new game and rust there was a white paper that came out on it and Catherine will be talking about using rossed at chucklefish and what it's like to use rust in the wild and video game development

  
 I don't know about you all but as someone who has a hidden passion for knowing about game development I am dying to see this video I am so looking forward to this closing Keynote

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for this thing and as always keep on resting
