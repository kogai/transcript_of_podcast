  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 21 February 28th 2018 our first item this week is probably one of the most awaited features of rust especially if you're a benchmarking fanatic as I may have mentioned on the podcast before Cindy has been a long-standing feature of only the night that users and never the staple ones I like put together a proposal that moves Cindy to stable and that proposal has now been accepted that's right Cindy will finally make its way to stable and find its way to a release in the future if you followed the language shootouts you may have been frustrated at Russ never scores is highly as you think it should this is due in part to the lack of Cindy support and Cindy is going to be one of those things that allow us to go that last Mile and close that Gap

  
our next bit of news is around wasm and rust so Nick Fitzgerald or if it's Jen I do sometimes known wrote an article recently about using just compiling to webassembly and parsing source-maps his first article look at how to optimize sourcemap parsing with this technique someone wrote a pretty cheeky come back that says while you may not need Ruston webassembly his follow-up article I think it's Exquisite it's really well done it really looks in depth at what you can do with rust and targeting webassembly and getting a lot of optimizations largely for free you don't have to be a JavaScript expert you don't have to understand the virtual machine inside and out you can choose rust in a very natural way and Target webassembly and then use that in your application I'll be sure to link that in the show notes so you can read the whole article

  
we now have two more active working groups I mention these working groups would be spending up soon and sure enough this past week to working group so spun up one of them is the embedded device is working group that shaparak leads this of course is taking his knowledge and experience and really expanding it to a full working group of people sound that a targeting specific and Buddy devices other set up at more broad but of course the focus being let steak rest and put it on as many embedded devices as we can I mentioned him a little bit earlier in the podcast Nick Fitzgerald is standing up his team as well so this is the Russ + webassembly team trying to make Russ work as smoothly as possible with webassembly

  
there's a whole bunch of work to do on both the embedded side and the rust webassembly side so I encourage you to check it out if you're at all interested
