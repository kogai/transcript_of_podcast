  
hello and welcome to the Rusty Spike Lee rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 22 March 7th 2018

  
 our first season this week is around 3 numbers 1-20 for one that's right for those of you paying attention it's been a hotfix release of the rust 1.24 release this hotfix addresses a couple of regression that snuck into the 1.24 release big shout out to the Russ release team for turning things around quickly and addressing these issues

  
 some cool news the rust 2018 roadmap was accepted SRC details data that came from the 2017 survey and feedback that came from nearly a hundred blog post that talked about where the future Rush should go one of the core pieces of the rust 2018 roadmap is C R Us 2018 release this is the first major release of rest since its first 1.0 release in 2015 there's a couple other key points of the 2018 roadmap butter were calling out one of them which was a big pointy feedback in the 2017 survey was around intermediate resources things like new documentation videos explanations for people coming from different backgrounds

  
 a lot of people need just a bridge from their current language to rest kind of a decoder ring that helps them takes a concept they already know well and say Ruby or Python and then translate SunTrust

  
 incidentally if you're interested in helping out definitely check out the rest documentation team and another big piece of the rust 2018 roadmap is around empowering more regions and more leaders R Us is growing quickly and of course we have to grow leadership quickly along with it in order to actually be able to support all of this growth

  
 that means not only mentoring new leaders and putting new teams in place but of course also making sure that around the globe people have the best information they could have had to make sure things like the tools work well and have good hair messages excetera if I walked all the way through this red wrap it would probably take me a good 30 minutes

  
 our next news item is close to my heart and I'm sure close to many of yours it doesn't you who have had to struggle with that compile time that just feels like it just creeps up little by little bit got some good news for you there is now working group a sub team of the compiler team focused on compiler performance that's right compile times now have a team Focus just on them I made a quick note here that more Cindy support is already starting to land now that the Cindy on stable RC has gone through and just sit at a team that works at Mozilla reach out to me and say they're already starting to move to this new Cindy support so it's super cool to see if people actually picking it up and immediately starting to use it

  
 had a bit of serving used around this out I may have mentioned Pathfinder in this podcast before that Fighters away of rendering fonts and vector graphics in your GPU and of course because of that is actually quite fast the developer that's been working on Pathfinder has in secret been working on a very cool project is managed to RT Implement parts of Pathfinder inside Firefox at self I like you some cool screenshots where he's showing Firefox using Pathfinder so I'm really looking forward to what will be able to do in the future but some of this new technology

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and keep on resting
