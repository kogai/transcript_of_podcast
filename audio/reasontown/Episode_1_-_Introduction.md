  
hello everybody and welcome to the very first episode of Reason town where we talked about reasonml and its community and the language I'm your co-host Murphy Randall and I'm here the other co-host Jarrod Forsyth and we are going to talk today about what the reason that we are making this podcast why we like reason and how we got into it but first I do want to mention thanks to the company that I work for day one for sponsoring this podcast and giving me time during work to produce a podcast and Jared is your company as well if you want to mention your company and thank them so I work for Khan Academy and I'm very grateful they're very supportive of my work in the office or community

  
I want to see it myself too cuz I was sick yesterday so my nose sounds pretty funny right now which affects my voice so I don't normally sound funny but I sound funny here today and if she was the first time you heard me I guess I bought it always sounded like a butt without further Ado let's get started so Jared I think that your story is more interesting and fell in the night at this point that I am so let's start with you and then I'll follow up with my story sure so I was first introduced to reason when I was interning at Facebook and 2015 and I was on the react native team and I was sitting across from Jordan walk who's the original creator of react and he was working on the school project that he called reason and it was you know a layer on top of a camel that would compile to JavaScript and have all these type benefits so he was working on a back then and it was interesting to me

  
and so over the kind of year after that I would kind of drop in and see how it was try things about do a little bit of contributing but it didn't manage to grab me until about a year ago when I dropped him again and all the sudden the piece that kind of clicked into place where I could I can actually start building real things and that was so exciting to me probably is a good idea to mention to that listen to happen we're just stopping for the first time maybe haven't used it was just give me a quick idea of what reason is but it's relationship toe camel is and totally so reason is it's a layer on top of a camel it's a new syntax that is designed to be familiar to people coming from JavaScript or Java more languages with a similar send text to that

  
it also has a lot of improvements to the tool chain the build system and various things to make it interoperate seamlessly with JavaScript and npm packages and that kind of thing so in general it's it's a new community around Oak Animal that's very focused on being friendly to beginners people that are just getting into it excellent and the type system it it does have a type system right yeah it's very powerful been around for 20 years and it's one of the standard type systems I guess you could say their names and so does the tax system is quite powerful and it's fully so you don't have to annotate everything but the compiler will figure out oh you use this like a string so I'm going to enforce that it's used as a string everywhere

  
this is a little bit nicer to ride in the Java got scared off by types when doing Java initially or C plus plus or something it's like so much time writing these types and fixing them and maintaining them and when you're writing reason you can get through a hello world program without hitting any types and that's really nice so cool to the weight the reason I can do this now I'm going to be sensitive about saying the word reason all the time but the reason that it can do this and you know camel sound system is because since reason is only any Syntax for okay well you can pass the same abstract-syntax-tree right and then uses all the same compiler tools and type checking that okay with her eyes that correct exactly

  
so cool so the way it does that is to another project called bucklescript which is comes from a different company but is as a far as I understand this kind of emerging efforts right now I got the script it was originally for compiling Oak Hamilton jealous because I right that's right so the folks at Bloomberg apparently have been using okay well for a while and they wanted a faster compiler for JavaScript for getting Oak Hamlin to JavaScript and so Bob saying started working on that and what is blazing fast most most populations take a couple of seconds and the output is quite readable you can browse through the Android source code on doesn't look like you're somebody and over the past year or so yeah bucklescript and reason have kind of been merging efforts to just make a really seem less experience when

  
operating with JavaScript ecosystem right now then if you play listening those are the terms out here is like reason because the syntax okay, which is the link business in taxes based on and scripture Jessica Pilar or rather the translation layer that compiles okay I'm off to JavaScript great so I want to clarify before I move on

  
 that's probably the big ones react maybe we should mention for non friends and people react as a front end JavaScript framework for application development in JavaScript and the people that are working on reason are also the people that built reacted so there's quite nice in her up between those two years ago it got to the point where you could tell 7 and then he started taking up on that you also mentioned contributing the language so like what are your contributions look like I've done a couple of things one of them changes

  
 there was a big upgrade to the syntax last October and it basically moving it even more in the direction of JavaScript considered there were lots of little things that need to be changed and I jumped in and help out with that changing the parser and that pretty printer and then I've also contributed some to the error reporting I've always been very jealous of Elms wonderful error messages and so there's been some effort and reason to get error messages that are at least a little bit as good as Elm and I've helped out with that so good I love that that's something I ran into right away when doing getting sorry with reason and I just felt at home because I do it all the time our sister podcast is Allentown and so that's why the reason why you're not here and I love the day like

  
 I was going to say beginner-friendly but it's more like Simplicity friendly at like it's more like just good user experience to have you help me compile our messages so you don't have to be like hardcore know the right word is for that but to some degree like reading cryptic error messages can make you feel like a boss you're also not the necessary like you know like just is just as unnecessary is like learning to use a really bad user interface you have to be steeped in the development environment in order to be able to quickly make sense of our error messages and even for season developers if they are messages easier on finding the right word

  
 for sure so what is your involvement with reason as far as not necessarily limited tribute Urban as a user right now the most recent thing I did was I released mobile game entirely written reason to the IOS app store in the Android Play Store what they called it's called Gravitron that was a really fun project to just write a game have these great types and then without very many changes to it how to compile to JavaScript on the web native desktop and then native Android that seems pretty insane to me I want to know more about this tell me like what was the what did you use to drop axles to the screen did you have to change that on all three platforms like how did you obviously were just compiling Java Script made a compilation works for the different platforms how did how did you do this

  
 processing is created by Sean Avery and Ben San Souci both active in the reason and this library is kind of a port of processing if you're familiar with that it's so easy Graphics library and they build it on top of opengl so in JavaScript just compiles to webgl interactions and then on Native and mobile native it just goes to opengl 2.0

  
 that is insanely cool you just use reprocessing in for free you got all three platforms I had to do a bit of work when I first started this game it only targeted and desktop native and the iOS part was kind of half done so I came in and I finished the iOS port and I made an Android port then after that work was done I gotta love her wow so okay so this is really it seem like cool cuz this isn't something that that only uses JavaScript has to as a pile Target like for that platform as compared to any of the other languages that are out there where reason can be the best way to write JavaScript or

  
 you don't have to switch languages when you want to write a server that's fast or when you want to write a mobile app that fast so let's talk about that for a sec if you were going to write a server in a reason right now is it the kind of thing where you would do like running on node and use express or would you just use reason as a way to write a camera and use existing o camel server stuff like what would you do there personally I would probably take it back on Express at the moment because the community libraries aren't nearly as easy to use my hope is that as people as a reason community grows in people start writing more libraries a year from now a year and a half from now I'll be able to just use

  
 native reason libraries and compile to assembly so cool so cool so that's actually interesting like if you were going to do that for example file to assembly somebody would have to ride like a web framework in reason using an I like a TCP stack for example right I are there apis that are available for that so it would be like like if I were going to go right that and I said okay well I'm going to write the server in reason I have to have some kind of access to the networking tools of the OS what I say like I'm doing this on the OK Google back into or the Jazz back in like how would how would I choose what what that was and what it wouldn't be compatible between different if I if I wrote that server I couldn't pilot to JavaScript if I were using the Show camel library for peace piece. Is that correct on how you set it up

  
 you definitely need different different back and so to speak one for using maybe the note g s h t t p Belton library and one for using the O camel Unix built-in library but you could you could make a layer on top of that that was pretty similar because both of them are just talking to OS sockets underneath and then from that low layer every all the code that you ride on top of that could compile to JavaScript or native to make sense and then they were Dyson there would be some way that's not yet established to say like well depending on the back in your compiling to it's all these different packages or like I said this environment variable or something right use the right thing so bucklescript you mentioned before then so she has made a a fork of bucklescript that knows

  
 just what you were saying you can specify this should be native compiled officially jobs for compiled you know if we're on this this is so cool so it sounds like we're still pretty early on in the development and usefulness of reason and I picked up on that anyway but it is helpful to hear the details from you to so for listeners if you are also interested in getting into this I would expect at this stage at this point in time to be to be an early adopter is that how you feel to Jerry like this sucks going to be changing pretty quickly especially in terms of community libraries if if you would ask me six months ago I would say it's very bleeding edge because the syntax was changing the belt system was changing it was lots of stuff influx of settled down but we're still

  
 we don't have the the libraries in place that will need to have a truly easy to get started with experience I've been very impressed by the rest project language and there they've been very self-aware about how ready they are there was a website called are we web yet that would list basically it was is rust ready for making web servers and it kind of listed all of the puzzle pieces that needed to come in place for us to be an easy to get started with cannabis thing and that website ran for I think 3 or 4 years and was regularly updated and now it says yeah go ahead we're all set but two years ago it said we're mostly there

  
 I'm just saying I wonder if someone to be interested in something like that for no reason to that's really interesting so you can meet to be still needs quite a bit of building up I also noticed that like said send text has been changing and it seems like it will be changing again over time because the I diagnose from interactions community that there's still some opportunity to approve tax around need to find things to raffle strips to JavaScript and also in areas that have to do is promise chaining for example so those things are being worked on that right I made a an experimental syntax for for doing tough async-await and reason and there's there is work going on to make the external dining interface better but yeah there's there a lot of little things like that that a year from now 2 years from now we'll will be much more important to tell me

  
 they secrete experimentation is this like how does this move forward this is like you propose it people look at it and say that sounds nice and then at some point it gets implemented experimental and the compiler people try it out like what's the what are the steps in the timeline from I came up with this idea to its release to the wild

  
 but one of the nice things about the the Holo camel compiler tool chain is that it basically has Babel built in in JavaScript if you are using the Bible transpiler you can write plugins that the take a nasty and transform it to a different one and Oak animal has has had that for for many years so what I wrote was one of these macros essentially and so you can actually right now install this and Pam Library configuration changes and try out this async-await send text what's a library called it's called reason a sink reason underscore a sink

  
 that is really interesting so tell me more about is This Promise specific because I know that in in JavaScript async await only works at promises not even generators just promises right but in the functional world and especially worlds like Haskell you have all kinds of known as where the promises in the monad it's just an abstraction if you're listening in like it's just like you know I go list is an abstraction that lets you store data that is a different extraction with different rules and different ways to interact and one of those ways did the monad is to say like do something after this first thing is so that's what the promises promises. Then and then you do another thing that's another promise so that's like your kinetic find swear you say like I have do this thing in that I brought into this next thing so in Haskell we have something that's called the denotation where you could send tactically very easily say do this monadic thing then do another one had a thing at cetera and it works for

  
 future / promise I'll stuff and it also works for like maybe they're optionals and so does yours and text plug-in work for options for example or is it only for GPS. Promise it does work for options to that's really cool tell us more about that how did that how did you do that so what the transform does is when it transforms it into basically a. Find on whatever module is currently opened you you can specify I want to use a single weight with Thomas's or I want to use it with options or I want to use it with observables for example and then you know everything in your coat after that decoration will be using that kind can they be nested

  
 we're going to Brian's I can do another await for example that's really cool so but what about something like now this is not something I almost ever have to do but sometimes it is convenient so I'm curious about some things like the concept of money Transformers would you just say like just avoid that idea for now where you could take one monad and like lifted into another monads so you don't have to have nested awaits is debatable for me it's debatable as to how often that's actually necessary in at least outside of Haskell what do you think of server several months ago and I felt the need for that that's why I start implementing that and then later I end up refactoring such that I didn't need it anymore that's how it's like you you're in this motor in Psycho I just need this and then it'll work and then later

  
 it turns out you didn't need that you just need a tow structure code better

  
 set up for right now the answer is like just do it symbol way and maybe that maybe restructure stuff if you have to you probably can that person actually won't get in your way but

  
 I don't know that it's necessary okay so if I downloaded reason a sink and I started to use it how risky is that like How likely is it that this experiment will be something that is adopted into the actual like standard bucklescript the reason send text and if it doesn't am I like what's what's my plan for moving off of it if it if it goes away things like that like sure I'm guessing it's experimental I'm not intended as a tool that's like hey everyone just use this right now is that correct will it's simple enough that you can probably you can you can read through the entire source code in 10 minutes probably so if if you want to depend on it that's fine if you want to like if the community decides all we want to do it the other way then you can you can keep using my library for as long as you want or you can transfer your code

  
 to use whatever we decide on okay and then so tell me a little bit about are there any existing tools for automatic source code a Transformations I know we have a refund to which is awesome it's it's like Elm format it's like go fund it's it's basically just takes your code Parts as it turns it into a nasty and rewrite it out so that is always consistent and I are there tools for being able to automate transformation of the source where you can read your code into a nasty actually transform the SD and then right back out to its source so like what's a what's a reason a sink isn't the way it goes in the end can I ride a tool to just go through my 10,000 lines of code and transform my reason they saying stuff into the music

  
 so that's something that we ate we haven't seen any tools made for that yet but I would love for that to happen all of the pieces are in place somebody just needs to write a nice CLI tool and a nice format so that you can create these kind of syntax transforms and the biggest place that I see the potential is being used is in libraries when for example upgrading a major version of your reason you notice a reason we act goes from version 3 2 version 4 and it changes a bunch of apis it could just provide an auto upgrader that will go through and you know it's essentially seamless that's really really cool and actually there's a precedent for that and JavaScript right I mean that is actually what happens with react JavaScript a shift code mods that you got to run using put my tools so cool so there's a cool call to action for someone who wants to contribute maybe dive into make a make it

  
 mod tool for reason I love it so let's talk a little bit I think that I got us off track by geeking out a bunch of details what did you finish telling your story of how you got into it and like what you're doing with it in where your headed at cetera yeah I think I think I got it kind of your journey to reason cuz I think that's also really cool cuz you've been doing L mostly at day one but then suddenly you're you're getting shouldn't reason as well that is an interesting story let's see if I can cut it down to a short amount of time but I do want to use alum for the front end stuff for all of our friend in tools and I think that Elam is a beautiful to land a wonderful choice and that one of the reasons I like him so much is that it tells a complete and compelling story about front end application development so like

  
 in JavaScript react World maybe you have reacted just like your view layer and then maybe you have read extra managing your state and your single stay at one end well y'all have to manage side effects of maybe you get like three ducks ducks like redux-saga I like they're all these pieces that maybe you mix together and kind of like pick your pick your favorite one and some of them and they're in different states of development and so there can be some noise there mentally as to how to afford element is complete it includes all of those things for you it says like here's how you do your views here's how you do your state representation you say okay. Here's how you manage your side effects in the store and I love that I felt like that cohesive storytelling is worth the trade-off setting there are trade-offs like you it's a purely functional language so you have to learn to program a purely functional fashion it sometimes it's it's harder to do sometimes side effect you things like so you want to like get Bound in Clinton tractor animation there you have to

  
 that becomes more difficult but press that story has been compelling complete so we we use on for all those things but there's still lots of stuff you need for stuff that like parts of the web platform that aren't implemented an album yet and you need to use their like the FI Elms Elms for infection in her face which isn't really saying it's more like a way of communicating with the outside world to call out to JavaScript and access apis that aren't implemented yet announced that way and so I found myself reading a bunch of JavaScript to get some of our sink logic done and day one and I used typescript for that I I tried flow which I've I've actually used flow for a few years and I think it's really neat project but that has never actually really panned out for me so I tried flow and then ended up going with typescript

  
 and then also found a lot of frustration there that's what it the code is actually still in typescript but the frustration for me with the flow typescript approach is that you have very partial coverage of your coat like you only get type safety guarantees from typescript and flow if you are very disciplined about how you use it and if you don't understand types types systems well like coming to come into typescript inflow specifically flow years ago like a couple years ago I started using flow and I was coming from JavaScript python like mostly untyped background and so I didn't understand how to use teksystems at all and so a loose type system that needs discipline is not a great place to start learning about how types of Sims work at least in my opinion as there's a lot of work required to say like I promise I'm not like like it's really easy to lie to the type system and then he like have it not be useful to you almost at all because it'll Discovery like oh I was just wrong about my types that I told that

  
 I had them so it's so it's like an extra layer of work so I was very excited and also I learn to program in a functional style I really like that and the JavaScript isn't really a function language like it's it's kind of designed with object-oriented programming in mind and some functional capabilities like higher order functions but JavaScript isn't equipped with the kind of tools where you can just diving to be like yep it's natural to program functionally and because of that language is like slow in typescript you kind of have to bend them out of shape to make him work functionally as well so I had to kind shift paradigms from Elm when I was going back to JavaScript to say like okay well now I'm going to be object-oriented again if I want my types of some to work for me so I had like a different language in a different paradigm

  
 cuz I wasn't really comfortable with that now. Script is super awesome. Scribs is a purely functional languages that compile to JavaScript and I did write a bunch of your script code I love I really like the people behind that project I really like to project but it didn't end up feeling appropriate either the FI The Form and Function interface for your script is pretty easy to use but it wasn't it didn't feel easy use enough to make it feel like I should write JavaScript using your script at that point if that makes sense so like I

  
 closer than Elm but not close enough that it felt like you were mostly writing better JavaScript so so one thing about JavaScript JavaScript isn't pure and a lot of the times that you go in JavaScript is because that's where you're going to do your imp your stuff right now and that's where I got on my. And then I go out to JavaScript and I'm like okay here's where I'm going to be like I'm a deal on my interest I thought you and not just got this. And so it felt like okay I'm coming from my my pure tell him to a different pair language and so I still have to do like less JavaScript things and so I stopped to do about you like raw JavaScript stuff and it could be that I just didn't understand the language well enough while I was doing it but it still at felt like another layer of work that wasn't close enough to JavaScript to make it useful yet but when I started looking at reason and okay well I was like all I think this is the key for me because I owe camel is not

  
 like it doesn't make it hard to be pure but it doesn't require Purity so that it that gets out of your way a little bit so it's a trade some Purity for pragmatism and but but it is functional like okay what is a functional language in has those things that I expected Curbing and the type system etcetera and it's super fast but I actually so I think one of the biggest reasons I would want to use reason over any of the other things I mentioned so far is that the tooling for the interaction within p.m. is the best I see like your script is gotten better typescript I can't even tell you how many hours I've spent like frustrated Lee trying to figure out what my ts can fix should have in it to even get started but that's a that's a complicated story right now and it's because they've been developing for years but that's still like getting started with typescript has not been an easy experience for me and understanding how to interact with libraries that are already existing also has been very pink

  
 because like they don't have a clear ffi in typescript there is no FIB cuz I like always just drama scripts so it's like you don't know when you're using JavaScript versus the actual like like sound of type system but there's also not an obvious way to say like okay well I'm going to bike get these findings like these type rapping for this Library cuz it's it's implicit I mean they're probably listening going like you just tell him you don't know you're talking about that's true but the experience I had with it was that it was painful to try to find good type definitions for libraries and feel confident and is painful to try to interact interactive my existing non tax code and etcetera but with reason that BS tool chain

  
 the Buckle scripts West call BS platform that you install from the super fast you just install it like you do need to get a very basic config going which took me a bit to figure out but there are few options then to tell her about that other languages and so you just run it and you could pile on your JavaScript code and it's done like super fast and then you got JavaScript right there and you can also include it just piggybacks on in p.m. so if you want to install other packages you can install reason packages using in p.m. and then you can go ahead and use the packages so I'm getting into way too many details point being I feel like the speed and simplicity of using reason has exceeded all of the other options that I tried so far nobody really gratifying for the the reason maintainers to hear because they they put a lot of effort into making it easy to get started with especially with m

  
 and using JavaScript packages I want to also ask what are the things that stuck you what what are the things that got in your way that could still be a little bit easier to use when it's like me a little bit that I had to like in my BS Cafe guide to specify that I was using the reason three syntax I thought that the newest would be default sure I actually copied and pasted in examples from online it to say like can I get this running at all and they didn't compile at so I went into the to the chat and said like why don't the examples online compile and turns out I had to add that that I was using the syntax version 3 so that's stuck also the docs are getting better for reason and four and four buckle script but they're still spread across three sites there's like there's like the reason Doc's then there's a buckle script ox and then there's like the Buckle script API docs and so I I have to go to all three of those

  
 so I can be easier

  
 the Syntax for function in her face was difficult to get into my head and I still don't have it in my head I told him all the time but just a quick sign out that is another great reason to use this language is like the Form and Function in her face is very easy to use but also very explicit meaning like it's not just implicit like we're just going to magically interpret wet this JavaScript is like you you have to tell it what types are coming in and out so it's visually obvious that you're doing something within her off but it's also very easy like all the internet code is his right there and if so I think we got the great great thing that I send text might be a little nicer than work rememberable in the future if that will change but other man sticking points for me super that sounds good another problem is it like you were talking about Community Support right when you're first getting started with a

  
 Cutting Edge Leading Edge or early adopter language like this a lot of the time and effort that goes into it is finding like wrapping your libraries or writing new library right so I spent a bunch of my time writing a duck some wrappers for local forage and for mounting an L map coming up with a good like typed interface for those and creating rapper libraries for which you wouldn't do if your season JavaScript but that can that can be if you have time for it and that's how I actually considering using this for a server side project coming up at work and interactions couchbase but I'm also looking at okay we'll have to have so many hours to like write a type rapper around the note couchbase

  
 library in come up with a good dinner face for that so that's part of the sacrifice of using a new thing right right away maybe actually paved the way for somebody else but we might do that I did write some stuff and that we shipped so are using a little bit in production of day one and we are very interested in examining the possibilities of using it more in the future that's super cool using Elm and reason in concert one thing that I look forward to in this podcast is having people on and just seeing where they're coming from and what they're used case is for reason and how I solve their problems totally totally agree I think you can expect to get all the episodes like this one with Jared and

  
 I just talking talking about news talking about our own projects etcetera sometimes they're all the episodes of me interviewing people at one-on-one and sometimes it'll be episodes is Jared interviewing people one-on-one yeah. Here is that weekend cover reason and it's Community the people who contribute to the libraries are the people who make the language Etc because in the end any any language lives and dies by the community if there is a really small community it doesn't progress as fast as if you have a bunch of people all contributing whatever they have

  
 totally true and you know I think we've even seen less-than-stellar languages Excel because of the strength of the community too so let's maybe try to make it to the seller language exceeds the community exactly oh did you have some links I forgot that you said that you had some stuff to show people that right oh yeah I just wanted to double-check episode plug a couple of community projects that I think are exciting and the first one on my list is a CSS in reason Library bicycle pie who created glamour which is very popular JavaScript CSS in jayess library he created is called BS nice and it has all the types for various CSS attributes and it's still an early project but I'm excited to see where it goes

  
 and then the second project is called nak'd and it is bringing the actor model to know Jets have heard of in erlang and Scala where you have it it's a way to separate your different services in a server and the really cool thing about this project is that there is documentation for the JavaScript API and for the reason API so they're they're both first class citizens so cool and I think this is a great such a good president for libraries in the future where you can write in in Reading JavaScript appeal to both communities to tell me about this a little bit with this enable you to run multiple note instances and communicate between them is this like my Acura model is all within my one threat my OneNote sweater am I like yeah I can have like 60 different servers running different note processes and I'm communicating between them using message passing

  
 currently the examples only show single-threaded and I have to look in to see whether it supports multiple 4S okay cool great anything else unless we already talked about but reprocessing is just a super cool project that allows you to Target multiple platforms with your 2D Graphics so cool hey any thoughts on arm architecture like is there any thought about you know writing stuff that can run on arm processors with with reason

  
 and releasing my Android and iOS apps I I compiled 2 * 64 + r b 7 inside there there are Oak Hammock cross compilers that'll do that the story for cross-compiling in Oak Camo is pretty rough right now you have to do a lot of messing around but hopefully the future will a really good sport front so cool alright thanks for letting me know about that little bit great I wish I had some likes to but for now I don't so I will sign off by everybody see you next time
