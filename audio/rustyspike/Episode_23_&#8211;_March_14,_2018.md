  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 23 March 14th 2018

  
 there is lots of awesome stuff this week so let's go ahead and get started

  
 our first news item is about Amber those of you who are JavaScript programmers may have heard of the emperor framework over the last few months that team has meticulously been moving bits and pieces to the hub assembly and of course I have to call out that it's rust that drives that webassembly unfortunately I don't have much to link for this news item I can link you to a slider to that people have taken but I'm definitely looking forward to being able to link to the video itself so you can see it

  
 the rust 2018 roadmap RFC has now been version accepted and air put together a blog post that talks about the roadmap and also talks about the different pieces that will work together really deliver that new experience with rust and short you'll be able to and your cargo Tom will file set the addition of the language that you would like to use this allows the compiler to by default maintain that ongoing compatibility promise but also allow you as the programmer to opt into a more recent addition and get those new features you might worry about if you do so what about your dependencies do you have to go manually update then and the way that they have structured this you do not have to each dependency can be on its own Edition and the compiler will intelligently mix and match as needed

  
 and of course is part of this there's new work that needs to go into new documentation new examples and that work is already underway

  
 what are the websites that does tracking a programming language popularity and I think there's a pretty decent job is called red monk they measured by two different taxis on the first access they look at GitHub and the amount of pull request that projects in that language skit on the other access they look at the amount of questions being asked and answered and stack Overflow and their recent survey announcement red mug showed that Ross had grown yet again I had made it into the top 25 programming languages

  
 let's talk ideas for a minute so we talked a little bit about IntelliJ which by the way is awesome if you have not used IntelliJ and the recent Russ plug-in I highly encourage you to try it it's really cool jetbrains the company behind IntelliJ also works on a project called sea lion sea lion is the C C plus plus IDE built on similar technology and their recent update sea lion added support for rust and if you believe it for Tren and not only can you edit these languages but you can also Deepak so gives you more the teachers that you expect and I D I haven't had a chance to check this out yet but if you have tweeted me and I will share it with others so they can see how the sea lion experience works

  
 sorry next news item is around Mary Mary Mary mirror which is the middle intermediate representation think I got the right one of the stages the compiler takes your code through is called Mirror this intermediate representation around the same time that mirror is introduced in the compiler and interpreter was also created The Interpreter of course as its name suggests interprets the mirror hence Mir I marry but first Mary was a standalone tool that could work with mirror it became quickly obvious that you could use Mary in the compiler itself and sew a mini month project that got underway to move Marie into the compiler and why you might ask without going into way too much detail for a 5 Minute Podcast if I say something like let x equals 2 plus 3 both 2 & 3 are values that are known as

  
 call time and in fact the entire Expression 2 + 3 is also known as compile time the compiler knows what plus does to 2 and 3 by turning 2 + 3 into the singer value V the compiler saves having to do that at one time this is an optimization known as constant folding while using something like Mary to do concert folding is very much Overkill as you can imagine it does open the door to some really cool new things down the road one of these is constant expression and Not Just Cause 2 Expressions but also constant functions the ability to create whole functions that run at compile time this lets a compiler do quite a lot of activity up front that doesn't need to be done it runtime

  
 this could potentially and tell running Loops working on pointers calling even into the C standard Library as long as these things can be done at compile time then that information can then be put into the output code as you can imagine there's a lot of cool territory to explore here and a lot of programmers eager to do so

  
 that's it for this week again thanks so much for listening and keep on resting
