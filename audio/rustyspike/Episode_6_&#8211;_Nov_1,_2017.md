  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 6 November 1st 2017

  
 so there's lots of stuff this week so let's get started sorry first item this week is that Cisco is currently tipping their toe into some rest of element they recently released the dependency manager for developers that is written and Russ now it's currently targeting cplusplus developers as its first Target but it will be extended Beyond C plus plus two additional languages in the future and the next news item with a good stack overflows recent survey now the name of the survey is something like the dislike programming languages so I don't know if a lot of people actually read it because it sounds like a bit of a troll title but in this article is actually some really juicy nuggets about rust and how R Us is doing

  
 in the article what they're looking at is developers and the choices that they make when they're looking for new jobs now when they're looking for these new jobs they can put technologies that they would like to work with and Technologies they would definitely not like to work with the soda actually interpret the data you have to flip it upside down but Russ is one of the least disliked that is dressed as one of the most like Technologies in that survey Russ is also one of the fastest growing Technologies in that survey as well something like 30% growth since the last analysis but they ran

  
 our next news item is close to home for a lot of corporate developers of rust a lot of us who do roster open source developers and we don't mind sharing our code on crates IO with everyone else so it's very open source Spirit but what if your corporate developer that's working on clothes or systems maybe you're writing applications and multiple teams need to share the dependencies you can't really use crates I owe because again it's an open source system and you may not want to share the source code that these teams are sharing it to renew future of cargo called alternative Registries this it allows corporations to create an alternate registry that is a registry that isn't crates. IO and one that they can host so this allows corporations to share code between teams keep it all closed source and to continue using all the same rust tools that they're used to using

  
 a bit of news on the non lexical lifetimes that mouthful of a feature so nautical lifetimes is having its first in the series of pull request getting chewed up for the compiler the fact is being checked as I record this podcast so we may see that land this week I've asked Nico at this is ready for people to pick up and start using and he's cautioned against people picking it up quite yet but I find it very encouraging that this feature that a lot of us are looking forward to our now starting to find some life in the compiler and we're really looking forward to that serious of pull request landing

  
 so this next news item is about me and my big mouth so over the weekend I had the bright idea that I would post a tweet that said every time you like this tweet I'll give you a fun fact about Russ growth wow what a bad idea so the Tweet has been like something north of 430 * there's no way I could keep I did what I could I posted as many fun fact that I could I put those together into a blog post that you're welcome to check out there's a lot of fun stuff that you may or may not have heard of even if you had watching Ross really closely so definitely encourage you to check it out I was speaking of fun facts another fun fact is that the rust Reddit just passed 30000 subscribers it's such a cool Milestone to see the shredded growing so quickly

  
 I wanted a Servo news so recently one of the server developers put out a new tool that allows you to connect rust and JavaScript well more specifically rust and spider monkey that's the JavaScript engine that Mazda uses for Firefox having clean interop between rust and spider monkey allows us to have a much safer connection to the Dallas Convention Center allow us to use it in more places in fact the work may even lead to more performance improvements so we're really looking forward to that

  
 and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
