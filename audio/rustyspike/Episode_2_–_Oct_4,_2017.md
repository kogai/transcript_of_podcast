  
hello and welcome to the Rusty Spike podcast your source of news on the weekly for Russ and Servo I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 2 October 4th 2017 search jump in so the first news item this week is that non lexical lifetimes that mouthful of a future finally has been accepted RFC so what in the world are non lexical lifetimes

  
 if you've been using Ross do you may have noticed that the borrower Checker can sometimes be let's say a little conservative little Persnickety and these cases we're getting error messages for code that may be correct and we may not have any sense for why this particular area is happening the compiler is giving us an error message and places it shouldn't this is really weird nonlexical lifetime shine rather than being a specific feature non lexical lifetimes are refinement on the borrower checking process so that it's not giving us errors and some of those cases where are coats actually correct but previously the compiler had been a little too conservative to let it pass I'm sure that if you are like me and I'm looking forward to the barber chair giving you less errors and correct code and just focusing on the errors that it needs to report

  
 so the next news item is that rust fast just wrapped up rust fast being the rust European conference that happens twice a year so you miss the two that happened this year but good news the next one is spring 2018 and it's in Paris so that's a good excuse to go to Paris they might have been a long time coming but the results for the underhanded Russ competition are worthy of a read some of the most creative clever and devilish things I've ever seen someone doing rest are in these results imma leave the link and the description box you should definitely check it out there's some pretty hilarious thing there

  
 and the wait they did what department Google has had some problems with Russ they do some work in fuchsia a little bit of rust bindings there in a few but Chrome OS now has a virtual machine monitor Britain and rust now the author of this says well this is just a personal project this isn't necessarily something Google's working on but I think it's awesome to see Google Engineers working on Rust

  
 so some Rust job news I was looking on Reddit and noticed someone had collected a recent list of companies looking for rust jobs while we see some names we seen before like Dropbox and Century wait we know that they've done some rest we talk cloudflare which is also pretty cool that cloudflare is now hiring rest of offers and another bit of rust job news if you happen to be a PhD student or a master-student who's interested in Rust there are now positions for rust interns I'll leave the link in the description she can check it out if you're interested

  
 and finally a bit of Servo news if you are FreeBSD user I know I was a previous to user as an undergrad so this is this is fun to see this there are now people building serve at work in FreeBSD it's still very early days but people are starting to post screenshots I'll leave a link to one of those and you can check it out and that's it thanks so much for listening and keep on rusting
