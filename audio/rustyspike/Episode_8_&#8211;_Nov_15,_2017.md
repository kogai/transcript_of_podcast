  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast on your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 8 November 15th 2017 okay let's start things off so our first news item of course it's probably the biggest news item we've had her rust and a long long time and that is that Firefox Quantum release this is the first release that has a major piece of raw stand Servo code in it this of course is the style system nickname Stylo who's been a lot of work to make Firefox Quantum as fast as smooth as possible and if you haven't yet I definitely heard you to give it a go and see what you think if you're interested to learn more about how it happened and what kind of pieces when where there's to block posts that are linked in the show notes one is to Lynn Clark's explanation of what Firefox Quantum is and the other is called Fearless concurrency and Firefox

  
Quantum it kind of emergency Fearless concurrency aspect of rust and with the Firefox Quantum Story the kind of tells you how it happened Switching gears a bit let's talk a little bit about the rust compiler so a couple of things are landing or have landed this week that are definitely of note the first one of these is the continued progress for the incremental compilation Sue Negril compilation will be able to work with type checking as well this is a really key piece of being able to do really fast ideas with the russ compiler like many things it's not quite ready for prime time yet in that this is the first of many stages but it's really cool to be able to see how each step lands and then to see that progress building towards what we know will be probably some of the coolest ID experiences Russ's ever seen

  
so this next bit of compiler news is about webassembly support in the compiler so recently Alex did it to firm he landed better support and webassembly in the nightly compiler and he released a new tool called wasm - GC so these two tools work together to give you a much smaller webassembly output from your rest and it's really cool to see a glimpse what the future might look like

  
 this one is pretty cool I have to say if you haven't seen this screenshot yet I'll link to it in the show notes so I'm sure many of you know the redox operating system this is an operating system made and rust and is continuing to mature with new features so someone showed recently that you can now run cargo and redox there this much closer to being able to self host and I think it's so cool that something that was created from scratch with rust and a and a dream actually is at the point of showing such progress and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
