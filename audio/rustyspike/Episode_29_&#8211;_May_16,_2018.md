  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 19 May 16th 2018

  
 we missed last week due to some technical difficulties so lots to catch up this week let's start with last week's news first there's a couple of companies that you've probably heard of that have just announced their first run projects the first of these is square the payment processing system squares new application is called pseudo pair Sito pair is a plug-in for pseudo the command that gives you a Superuser privileges this plug-in allows another human to approve or monitor any of the pseudo sessions those kind of a assisted man devops kind of tool the other company that was recently announced at least last week we got one more in store not to give anything away the other company that recently announced doing a bit of frost is Amazon they have a new tool called ascolano it's a tool and a library for detecting open source licenses in text so this is something that's very serious for a lot of companies that work with open

  
 being able to track where is Horace comes from what the license is who is responsible Etc that's awesome to see Amazon actually putting out some stuff and of course that will be awesome that is red and rust the course the biggest news of last week was the huge 1. 26 release you know when you get so used to the every 6 weeks having a new release sometimes you forget that somebody is going to be pretty big and this and this one of those big UNS if you haven't read through some of the features that 1.26 provides you should definitely check out the blog post or if you prefer podcast over reading text you should check out the new rest station podcast that cover the 1. 26 release but just a touch on the if you will the main things that are in this really is that what the whistle if you haven't already upgraded so here are some call outs for the 1. 26 release the rust programming language book 2nd edition is now the standard documentation

  
 for the release. It's been a long time coming I helped Carolyn Steve with the early versions of the second edition so it's really awesome to see this book start to come out in and really get used is the main documentation but of course it's more than just documentation wear them features let's talk feature is so this is the first stable release that has infiltrate a feature that really enables two kinds of things that are very tricky to do in Rust one so working with things like closures that have really complicated types coming out of a function now we can just say it implements a function trait without having to say the name that cannot be sad so that's definitely one awesome thing another thing it will trade allows us to do is to simplify where were using generics in our position does well sometimes you have to be to Eric because all I really care about is the trait and there is really no easy way to say that all I care about is just the tree as long as it whatever

  
 jobs in matches that right that's all I need so now we can do that and we can do so in such a way that has no runtime overhead that's super awesome it works just like a generic it gets the same efficient code what is a similar thing to read a couple other features in the 1.26 one is a definite quality of life Improvement which is better match bindings if you have had to do the dance of when do I add the Ampersand and when do I add the rep keyword now that is simplified for the vast majority of cases I know that was when things that I snagged on when I was learning and I'm sure a lot of you have to that's really great to see that paper cut fixed and the last of these and I'll call out in this podcast is that man can return the results which means tomorrow. Main can actually use the? Operator just like all the other functions

  
 I know this too was another kind of paper cut my people are starting to use? Operator that will you can't use it in Maine and now you can alright so that was last week so what happened this week this week we started off with yet another company talking about their use of rest cloudflare recently hosted a R Us meet up in the meet-up they talked about some of the technology they been working on built with rust they're not a couple of projects and I'll link to the slide deck so you can find out more but in short Cloud first targeting some of the sensitive places that exploits can happen with rust so that those same exploits cat happen in the future I'm sure not only is cloudflare sleeping a little bit better at night but so are they users so that's really cool to see us at celebrating its third official year since it's 1.0 so happy birthday Russ it's been a heck of an amazing set of 3 years and I'm so looking forward to the next three Aaron Roblox

  
 post it go along with the 3-year birthday that's a lot of reminders in this blog posts of all the things that have happened recently it's been a lot of stuff got one last news item we mentioned earlier in the podcast the 1. 26 release and sometimes when these releases got it's kind of like yay we get the new features this blog post is a little bit different so because of the new capabilities that one. 26 and nibbled namely some of the lesser-known features of the release and how they're able to improve performance for their application by three fold three times the performance that it had before just like always I'll be sure to link that in the show notes so you can read the article yourself and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and as always keep on resting
