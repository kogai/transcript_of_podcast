  
welcome to the recipe spiked a weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and This Is Us episode 3 October 11th 2017 my first item this week is redhead is now publishing the Russ 1.20 package in their package system this package joins a set of new languages that red hat is now supporting which also includes the Klang llvm 4.0.1 released and the go one. 8.3 release that feels like everytime we see another vendor or another Linux distro support rods feels like another check in the Ross Box our second use item is kind of a two-for-one so there's been a lot of improvements to the compile times in the last couple weeks now these are just Landing this week out of the blue he said actually been developed for months and months and then the case of incremental has actually gone through a few rewrites

  
alright so what are these improvements the first of these improvements is the incremental improvements so finally the new and criminal system for anchor Mill population has landed it's called red cream now you don't need to know what red Korean stands for if anything it's more just the code word for the developers working on the compiler but this new system it's a new way of being more efficient with how they store the incremental metadata it's pretty cool to see what they are already being able to do now I mention that the sacramental system has been built over a series of months this new anchor metal version I still pretty new so take this with a grain of salt but they are looking at these benchmarks and seeing upwards of 30% Improvement on recompile times over the previous system so it's very encouraging to see that they're they're able to really push the bar for it that fast

  
and other compiler news send lto has just landed now send lto is an improvement and how we use the elevator and back into the compiler this is how the compiler actually I put the code that runs on your computer the way that we were using it before I was actually single-threaded and Alex the robot that he is has gone in investigated than lto this new way of sending code to lvm and I'm or parallel way now again this is another one of those early results are ticket with the a pinch of salt but they're already saying phenomenal speed up in certain cases sometimes operative two times or three times faster and a couple ation I know for a lot of folks the compile times of roast have been a constant sore spot so I'm really looking forward to see what all this work when we actually get it all landed and put in place I would have been able to do

  
a light switch the servo and wow this week I have a to z if you haven't seen it yet Lynn Clark who writes these really cool code cartoon wrote one about webrunner this is the rendering system in Servo that's being moved over to Firefox the name of the blog posts the whole web and maximum FPS how webrender gets rid of Jank and this thing is no joke a tour-de-force start to finish this about the length of a small book to be totally honest but it's amazing the amount of detail and the kind of clarity that surely brings the somebody that's actually pretty tricky subject a kind of wrap your head around I'll be sure to put the link in the show notes so you can check it out and that's our show for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
