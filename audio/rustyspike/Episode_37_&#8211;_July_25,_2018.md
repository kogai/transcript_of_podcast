  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 37 July 25th 2018 all right let's get started our first news item this week is around Russ 1.27. To that's right we have another Point release of the Russ 1.27 release this is again continuing the theme of closing those soundness issues finding a fixing these bugs quickly is important and in the blog post there's also a write-up talking about this point really says these fixes seem to be helping a little bit more regularly these days doing part to a couple of reasons the first of course is trying to get to fix out in front of users as soon as possible is especially true for users on the stable Channel II and perhaps a bit of an unfortunate truth it's at the bar Checker is showing a bit of its age unfortunately some of those fixes are pushing it in ways perhaps it wasn't originally intended

  
the good news here is that the bar Checker is being Rewritten using updated R Us techniques and updated Bauer checking techniques. Of course Lisa things like non lexical lifetimes so we have to whether this a little bit longer before we can turn on the nll based engine but of course the teams will do so when it's ready

  
 if you've been falling breaded or Twitter this week you may have heard the crushing sound of God of War smashing his way into the rest Community that's right one of the companies behind God of War ready at dawn has an ounce in a recent tweet that they are moving away from C plus plus and we'll be using R Us for all future development I'm looking forward to that radiates down joints chucklefish who announced earlier this year that they too were also moving to Ross for one of their upcoming projects are next news item it's around some of the fix is coming to a nightly near you so there's been a steady Trickle and improvements to error messages another set of improvements are coming shortly he's going to help me use hers and you know Seasons user so like that make these mistakes cuz you know we do let's talk a little bit about the rest 2018 release we know that the rest 2018 Edition is coming later this year

  
 leading up to that will be time so to be important for us as users of the nightly for those who do you use nightly to test the Futures out and make sure to give feedback to the teams so they can make any necessary Corrections the call for help this week was around the module system which of course is he in a lot of changes with the rest 2018 edition of course late to that call for help so you can join in and have your feedback and one last bit of news so I may have mentioned Creighton on this podcast before it's kind of a code generation optimization in Gen 4 webassembly it originally was created to work alongside the spider monkey JavaScript engine to go to a fast webassembly engine but has since grown to be something a little bit closer to say an lvm a very light weight fast lvm great-aunt has now been renamed crane lift and has increase the amount of Outreach that it's doing to users to get more people involved and two

  
 continue building out what's possible in crane lift this may include in fact using it as a back-end for rust in the future since you're interested in Rust cogeneration compile time or if you just happen to be a computer hacker and want to jump in definitely check it out

  
 and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and as always keep on resting
