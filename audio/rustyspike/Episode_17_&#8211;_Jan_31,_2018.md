our next news item I kind of gave the head earlier so we are now talking about the rust 2018 roadmap and Toronto Rusty dat Mozilla has been working on the next road map from over a hundred different rust 2018 blog post and the 2017 survey results I like to hit in the show notes there's a lot of really cool themes what are the things that Erin does well I think in this proposal is to really narrow it down to a couple of key themes a couple of key goals this allows us to focus really on shipping as one blog writer put it rust in 2018 should be boring which is a kind of a funny way of saying that really we should focus on what we already do well and polish it to a shine

  
already Aaron's RFC that is proposing this roadmap has gotten a lot of positive feedback I definitely heard you to take a look and read it and share your thoughts
