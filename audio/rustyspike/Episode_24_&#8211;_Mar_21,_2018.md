 last episode was a long one this one's going to be a short one the first news on him this week is about conferences the first Russ Latin American Conference has been announced and will happen in 2019 so if you happen to live in Latin America you do have to wait a little while but it's awesome Syrah starting to grow in South America and beyond our next news item is about more programming language features especially ones that people are very excited about so without boats has been working on a new proposal for async-await this is gone through many iterations and I recently posted episode 6 if you will to their blog post that talks about how far they've come in actually being able to develop async-await for rust so they're really sticky issues around how ownership works and is he could have actually been solved headed talking with people like Nico and Aaron and others it seems like we're well on the way to actually being able to have real async-await as part of Russ I'll make sure to LinkedIn

  
 shut up stupid ass blog posts you can learn more well this actually be part of the 2018 edition of rest only time will tell but there's actually a pretty good chance that we will of course when you're trying to do a release as big as the rest 2018 Edition sometimes things don't quite make it and if they don't that's okay there's already so much progress It's happening so many cool new feature African async-await that'll just be icing on the cake and I next news item we talked about electron apps electron apps aren't they just JavaScript apps you might ask well if you haven't seen it yet I'll link it in the shadows it's a cool blog post talking about writing electron apps in Rust that's how about some cool tricks in the blog post how to improve the Performance Acura 6 of electron apps using rust and then how to measure it so definitely check it out if you're interested and finally one more last bit of news yours truly was able to sit in on the

  
 2018 released drivers meeting a group of people that are looking at the rest 2018 Edition at what needs to happen for at the ship and really high quality with all the documentation

  
 and that she can imagine like we mentioned earlier there's a lot of moving Parts a lot of features that are landing on a documentation that need to be updated and making sure it all tracks all the way from beginning to end so just know that behind the scenes as a group of people diligently working away to make that happen and if you happen to see any of them at a conference just tell him thank you and that's it for this week like I said short and sweet. Thanks so much for listening and as always keep on resting
