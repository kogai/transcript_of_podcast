  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things for us I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 27 April 25th 2018 some pretty awesome stuff in the news this week so let's get started our first news item it's about another white paper that came out the first Russ white paper covered a developer moving from java to rust and what they're able to do in this next white paper covers an indie game developer known as chucklefish so you Gamers out there and maybe you can lay over chuckle fishes previous work they were the publisher for stardew Valley they made a game called Starbound they've got a game coming out later this year called wargroove and they're working on yet another game called which Brook the white paper centers on which Brooke so why do we have a white paper about a new video game coming out you might ask well you know that inevitable answer in the back of your mind when you ask a question like that on this podcast that's right

  
that new video game is written in Rust now we've seen in the past video games written rust come out from any developers but this is certainly one of the biggest names in video games coming out with a rust base game the white paper goes and talks about why they chose rust over the traditional C plus plus for game development some of the advantages of using Rost in this scenario as you read you find out more in the white paper that chucklefish not on any is using Rustin that up-and-coming game but they actually gone back and rewrote some of their server code for the new game coming out later this year wargroove in Rust as well of course link to the white paper so you can read the story for yourself but it's pretty awesome to see any game developers especially really well-known one's picking up rust using at kapiling at to all the consoles and getting all the benefits

  
I've mentioned somebody's going to impress collaborations in the past I may have even mentioned the most recent hackfest the number 3 hack Fest in the previous podcast they've been doing some write-ups now that that hacked finished how about how successful it was the co-creator of genome held it as a complete success they're able to actually for the first time really big and really deep in the core fundamentals of the Genome Project and be able to represent them and rest this really opens the door for being able to rewrite some of those core libraries in cannone in Rust itself so it's been slow and steady progress but it's pretty rad to see that they're choking through it little by little so maybe in the future we'll see you can own in a distro near you that is written at least in part in Rust

  
so I seen some tools right by Facebook in the past where they have dabbled a bit with rust has yet another tool coming out which is pretty cool to see that Facebook is continuing to do some rest of element this one is called Fast mod it's a code refactoring tool for large-scale code bases I haven't used it myself yet but I will link to it so for those who are interested you can check it out our last bit of news about matchmaking so Aaron Tron tweeted recently that he would help matchmake between contractors that the rust team has used in the past and Company is that perhaps have work they want to have done in Rust maybe they want to make the compiler faster maybe they want to help out making utilities more flushed out with functionality so if you're listening to this and you're working for a company that's doing a bit of rest and you have some money on the side Aaron is going to help matchmaking so definitely reach out to him let him know what you can provide and he'll help set you up

  
and that's it for this week thanks again so much for listening and it's always keep on resting
