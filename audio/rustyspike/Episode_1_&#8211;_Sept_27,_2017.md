  
hello everyone and welcome to the Rusty Spike arrest and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this this is our first episode I'm really excited to start this podcast so the first news item will talk about is the Impala. If you've been watching the rest Community you may have noticed that they use a very peculiar design process called the RFC process now R C stands for a request for comment in just like it says it's kind of a request for people to jump in and give their comments their experiences even their own designs to the process

  
this allows a whole bunch of community participation but as you can imagine it also generates quite a lot of new designs and a lot of backlog in terms of what needs to be done so for the next 3 months starting in mid-september and running through to mid-December the teams will focus instead of on new designs on the implementation of these designs and it's really cool to watch them shift gears out of doing so many designs to focusing on just implementation

  
Aaron's her on one of the Russ core members recently wrote about the info. First week and said in its first week alone already 35 new teams have been created to help out with the info.

  
 So these teams cover a wide range of things so if your documentation writer if you are a programmer at various levels of experience with rust or if you're a web developer and have maybe some ideas and how to improve the rest home page there's a sub team for you and they've done a really good job of writing documentation to kind of pull you in and show you the ropes of where you can participate I really encourage you to check that out so this mixer side of his pretty cool so someone Sun analysis of the Energy Efficiency speed and memory usage across a variety of programming languages they found that rust it's the second most efficient in terms of speed and Energy Efficiency second only to see it's really cool seeing R Us going out there and really standing in the places where an embedded systems language would be most beneficial and speaking of embedded systems programming and rust may have already heard the name to parekh or Jorge

  
 Capriccio and the sky has been This Been Everywhere he did a tool called siargao x a r g o he's running a bunch of documentation for embedded programming Houston presentations it's really been out there really been helpful for embedded programming so recently he did a new book called discover the world of microcontrollers through us and this thing is amazing it's so full of information already I encourage you if you do embedded programming in R Us to definitely check it out and give it a try it so we can't leave server right and I've been some really cool stuff that's happened recently in the server world if you haven't seen it already Firefox 56 beta is now shipping as of a few hours ago I think this beta is the first one that has parts of Servo in it so it has the style systems from Servo ported over to work in Firefox and it's super cool to see that

  
 out in the world now

  
 one Lord little bit of Servo news so recently lived Servo had its first pre Alpha release lives overdoses project to take Servo and make and embedding API out of it so the team has made this API and they built applications that work on Windows on Linux on Mac OS and allow you to stand up Servo in a little window that you might use for about another idea in this is to be able to use it across a variety of applications but really fundamentally to have all the capabilities that you would need and pick up in bed in the way that you might a webkit application

  
 So currently the lip Servo apis is what I would say is very foundational it's not necessarily something that is very user-friendly but the idea is that all the functionality is taken care of I didn't help build a much more user-friendly experience on top of that for developers to use in the future and I just have to cheat an add one last news item this week this is from 2 weeks ago but I'm just so excited hearing about it so it lasts Shannon the makers of Jerry Trello bitbucket in Moore have officially joined the Russ friends page from the developer that submitted the Park West they said that they use rust in the service for analyzing terabytes of source code that I don't know about you but I just get the swelling of Russ Pride whenever I hear stories like that and that's it that's the end of our first episode big thank you for listening and keep on rusting

  
 or maybe you're a programmer
