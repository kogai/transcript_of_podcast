  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm a host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 14 January 10th 2018

  
 we've been off for a couple of weeks here and as you can imagine the rest Community does not sleep so this is going to be a little bit of a longer episode than your usual fare so its first take things off with some of the 2017 top items that happened at the end of the year this year in no particular order the first of these did the programming rust O'Reilly book is now available both in digital and and paper towards the end of December people getting their first copies of the mail excitedly showing them on the Twitter so it's really cool to see the book being out and having read the first few chapters I'm really excited about this thing I think is really appeal to a lot of people the next to these I mentioned in the previous podcast but that's a little while ago non lexical lifetimes is now behind a flag and you can try it out in the playground more than just being available on the playground has been continued Improvement of non lexical lifetimes so it's really encouraging c900 lifetimes continuing to improve seeing new coat starting to work

  
 I definitely heard you to check it out on your coat and see if it works for you

  
 and our next news item we have something and maybe a bit of a surprise for some folks who haven't been religiously watching the Reddit threads so we have the rust compiler and this is something that all of us know in love but did you know that there is a second compiler that's being built in C plus plus called M Rossi at the end of last year and Russy had mature to the point where was able to bootstrap trust allowing a second compiler to confirm that the output of the boot shop process was correct this is a big step and showing that Russ output a secure so you can trust the outputs of the rest compiler how's it going to majan this is a gargantuan effort to work on a separate compiler that's really impressive that I really encourage you to take a look

  
 and our next news item for those people that come to rest but still wish they had so the cool actor programming that you can do and go erlang there is a covered team Library called May that allows you to write in this lighter-weight actor style it's really cool what the author has been able to do with the original library and also porting over some common patterns to May so you can see how they work I'll make sure they put a link in the description so you can find out more

  
 with the end of the year the end of last quarter comes to a close which means that the end of the Apple. Also has come to a close Aaron has written a final ample. Newsletter this kind of wraps up the Impala. And tells you how the last bit of it went really cool to see those chickens and to see just really the volume of things that people were able to accomplish and then pull.

  
 And finally what would the end of the year be without of end of the year review so the rest the rest he of course has their own end of the year review and this thing you know you read and you remember just how much was done this year it's it's pretty cool I'll be sure to leave a link so you can read that for yourself but I'll be all security here with some of your favorite things that happened in 2017 where let's talk about what happened so far in 2018 the first of these is the hashtag rust 2018 blogging campaign is now going on this campaign is an opportunity for people in the rest we need to talk about what they see happening in 2018 for rust you can see a variety of blog post already people talk to you about some of the technical challenges that they want to see overcome some of that the community related things that they hope will grow stronger really the strength of this blocking campaign isn't just a few individuals but it's all of us riding together working together

  
 to really shape R Us to be what I can be

  
 our next news item is the rust release a car as it's that time of the year again so Russ 1.23 went out about a week ago it's a relatively small polish release but like always it's great to upgrade and get that nice little bit of Polish dough and rust 1.24 speaking of our next news item this is currently in beta and there is now a public service announcement asking for help on the Beta release now they have two main features that are going into 1.24 and I really would like people to make sure that they try these out before they get put in a stable release the two features are thin lto this is a way of doing cogeneration and parallel in El viansa compiler back end and cargo now has a criminal compilation enabled for non-release builds this means that 4 debug builds by default you'll begin using a criminal

  
 Appalachian this is been a long time coming it's been a lot of work to get this in place so definitely if you like 2 beta test if you're one of those early adopters Alexa try things out please do give it a go and let them know if the betta has any particular problems for your project this will help them shape it so that the stable release will be that much better the diesel one. Oh really it was getting awfully close and now it has been released diesel one. Oh is out you can now use it in this next news item speaking with crates we talk about a new cargo feature called cargo bloat cargo blow let you look at your code in a different way than we have in the past by looking at the amount of code being generated for different functions that's a name cargo bloat hence this is a way to check where the bloat is for those functions to go after them and then why is it so that your overall memory footprint can be smaller for your project

  
 I link to a write-up of using this for Clap the command line option parser is it cool step-by-step where you see the thought process of how to use cargo bloat and then how to apply that knowledge to your project

  
 and that's it for this week it's been great to have the break but it's also great to be back thanks everyone for listening and keep on resting
