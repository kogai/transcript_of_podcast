  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 9 November 22nd 2017 our first news item is about changes and the rust programming language so if you've done a lot of frost you may have noticed a lot of less than T greater than sin your code for new users these generic types can be a bit cumbersome and a bit daunting and even to those of us who are used to share code they also can be quite a bit cumbersome

  
what are the new features that the rust design team is currently working on his way to improve that so then simple cases you no longer have to write these generic types this is what's known as infiltrate that's i m p l just like the info keyword this infiltrates allow you to in a tight position say that what comes in implements a certain trait without having to go through all the rigmarole of naming the type and then putting the T in there and saying that that extends from something else instead you just say the name of the parameter colon and then the key word ample followed by the trade that it implements this may sound like a relatively small fix but to my eyes it actually does quite a bit of work to make the code feel a little bit later this in combination with other features the design team is working on I think will really improve the overall readability of dress code

  
our next news item is about the second Ruskin impact fast which recently finished there been 3 blog post so far talking about different angles of how the heck Fest went I'll link those in the show notes so you can read more information this next one is pretty cool I'll be at really detailed so I'm not even going to do it justice trying to explain it in this podcast so I'll be sure to link to this well this new change is an improvement to how the compiler does in memory representations of the types in your code some really clever optimizations that allow for example he comes or option of a type to take much less space made it previously the end result is without any changes to your code your code now is taking less memory when it runs again I'll be sure to leave those in the show notes it's really cool to see that you don't have to change your code and you can get this benefit

  
does next news item is another one that was close to my heart because I love the ID so the rust language server uses the language server protocol this is the protocol that was created in Visual Studio code and now is being supported by a growing number of IDs there have been a lot of ideas but there are a couple that have been sorely missing and one of those is Visual Studio itself the Maine Flagship IDE from Microsoft I'm happy to report that as of this week that Visual Studio will begin supporting the language server protocol this allows not only vs code and Sublime in these other ideas but in more in the lightweight side but now Visual Studio the big Flagship itself to potential in the future run the Russ language server it's not quite there yet but we're really encouraged by what Microsoft is doing and I'm looking forward to what the Deadpool's team will do with it

  
this next news item is about the good news about failing so if you've written a lot of rest code especially if you've used the? Operator I'm sure you've noticed that having multiple air types in a given function quickly fails the compiler can't handle those different hair types without both one of the rusty members at Missoula has been working on a new way of handling these errors called failure using failure and using some of the help her functions allows you to do so and such a way that you can use multiple air types so I'm really encouraged by What boat is working on I'm hoping that more people take this idea forward here's a news item for UFO SEC folks out there I'm sure some of you have heard the name suricato which is a security analysis tool a couple months ago they announced that they would be looking into moving part of their codebase over to rest this week they came out with some cool news items one that transition to Raw

  
houses in progress and to they're looking to hire to help with that transition I'll link to this news item in the show notes so you can go read more and if you're interested in applying you can do so

  
 I'm a bit of a correction from the last podcast I got a little over-excited the rust wasm back and that I said that I could been working on hadn't quite landed I'm happy to report that as of this week. Has not landed and you can play with the new Waz and back end in nightly

  
 at one last bit of news and this is a bit of feel good news if you need that in your week so Dan abramov who is well known in the web developer circles for working on things like react on Twitter recently reached out and said okay for those of you who are learning Ross but perhaps come to Ross from something other than CNC plus-plus what's it feel like there's a lot of to my mind really good feel good responses to his tweet so if you need an ice pick me up at the end of your week I encourage you to check that out and that's it for this week thanks for listening and keep on resting
