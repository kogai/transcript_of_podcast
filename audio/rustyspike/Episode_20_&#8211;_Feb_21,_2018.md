  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 20 February 21st 2018 first news item this week is rust 1.24 that's right a new release of rest is fresh off the presses this release of rust has two new features definitely have note the First new feature where is that the rust formatting tool rust font is now available as part of the rest up insulation so you can now install the preview of breast pump very similar to the RLS preview that you can install already this cuz you easy access to the rest formatting features add to the standard formatting rules that the rest formatting team has put together the other new feature of the rust 1.24 release is a criminal compilation

  
that's right for the first time in a rust release you can now get incremental compilation and the speed improvements that hopefully brings as part of your daily compilation routine so if you're working in debug built this is specifically for those debug builds you can now automatically get that a criminal compilation so it's very cool to see this actually rolling out into the wild and to see people using it on real projects if you begin using it on yours definitely let the team know this will help them to in the system so that it gets even better with each release and speaking of new releases this is one for you Ray on fans out there right on the popular parallel programming library for rust has now had its 1.0 release you can now take a dependency on it and feel a sure that you're working with something that will be stable and supported going forward switching away from new software releases let's talk a little bit about jobs jobs have come up a few times and was podcast

  
and this week. Are you at more job postings so Facebook has been working on Source Control Systems written in Rust the posting talks about a senior developer position that's now available if your rest of Oliver I'll leave the link in the show nose so you can find out more if you're interested in applying switching away from jobs that stalk little bit about some of the Articles coming out one of them is Fedor magazine has posted an article on Rust this is kind of fun article that walks through some of the tools that are written and rust that you can now use inside a fedora many of us are already familiar with ribcraft but there's a lot of other fun ones including one I had never heard of it totally Brookshire this name term turn them all turnable yeah it is an animal in the terminal say that five times fast

  
so definitely check out the article I'll leave that in the show notes

  
 another thing worth checking out is that Mozilla has posted a new white paper

  
 I mention these white papers before they can I go in depth with a company and ask them how they use rust and how rust improved what they did we've already talked about Tilda and its use of rust and this one is a company called Snips Snips does voice assistance similar to Amazon's Alexa but in a privacy preserving way they've been using Ross to squeeze out all the efficiency they can on these embedded devices and it's really encouraging to see that they took a small bit and then built up from there again just like always I'll leave the link in the show not so you can read the whole white paper and finally it always feels good to get a first place from time to time even a good second place I think I could second-place some of you have been following the techempower benchmarks these benchmarks cover some cute ass cover a wide variety of different software stacks

  
 the ones written and rust had seen some early growth to the top but now with the latest set of benchmarks were seeing some first place or rust and that's always an awesome thing to see and that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and keep on resting
