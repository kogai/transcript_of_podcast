  
turn on Welcome to the Rusty spike your Weekly News podcast on all things rust I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 33 June 13th 2018 there is a lot of stuff this week

  
 so you may not have heard of the crossbeam crate it started around the same time as rayon which many of you may have already have heard of crossbeam is a different set of parallelism Primitives and this week there is a new release of the channel implementation if you're at all familiar with how go Works eight channels are way of sending messages back and forth between go routines and rust using cross being channels that are similar being able to send information back and forth through the channels rest of course already has this in the standard library and a simplified form and this crossbeam channels not only has more features but is also much faster than once in the standard Library so definitely encourage you to check it out if you're Building Systems that need this kind of message passing speaking of channels and actors another bit of news on the actor front there's a framework called tactics that's a ctix tactics tactics is an actor framework for rest recently they topped the tech and Power

  
 tracks so congrats to them we've seen Ruess projects in the past start to push their way out to take him power benchmarks and it's really awesome to see you no one make it all the way to the top so congrats tactics link to another blog post that talks a bit about tactics and how to get started if you're interested and speaking of getting started with something there's another cool blog post I want to link you too and that is getting started with GUI programming in Rust there's a great blog post that explains how to do a simple to-do app using cute and rust and of course link to that she can check that out

  
 we haven't done Servo news in awhile and that's a shame so let's do some server news so it's been focused on a bit more mixed reality virtual reality that kind of stuff and recently one of the things they did was to upgrade their Spidermonkey implementation soda pull it from version 50 up the version 60 this will let them compete a lot better and benchmarks so be really exciting to see some of the numbers I'll be able to pull off in the future and speaking of showing off some pretty amazing things I'm sure most of you who are Gamers that listen this podcast have heard of Dota 2 this is an astronomical a popular video game

  
 recently was shown running on top of a portability layer that worked with metal that portability layer was called Graphics portability gfx portability gfx courses near us crate gfx so this means that they were able to build a compatibility there that set on top of metal and allowed you to run a full Dota 2 on top of it I just started showing the screenshots of course link to the screenshots in the description

  
 our next news item talks about Linux distributions and rust we recently saw a bit of movement on the Davion developer side getting rust crates ready to be moved into Davion there's of course a lot of work and distributions to support package systems like R Us has so it's really cool to see them able to automate the transition much more cleanly for next couple of these items let's talk a bit about operating system development now we seen in the past hobby developers picking up Ross and building operating systems with it Russ has that unique set of features that allowed to stay low level in against the metal and of course have a safety at the same time there are two news items that I want to bring up this week one of them may be familiar to some of our listeners one Russ developer fill it snows riding operating system tutorials for Russ developers and those have been around for a few years still recently put together a talk and then talk slides are great overview

  
 some of the key points of writing OS development in Rust that's like that gets a great read the other thing that I think has a great read coming in this week if you have watch some of the C plus plus iOS development in recent years you probably heard of this thing called live OS interesting idea of around can we in header files in simple cplusplus write an application and then compile that application down until it's a binary that can rhyme without any operating system at all someone recently did a proof-of-concept are they rushed base unikernel that's able to do the same thing. Of course like to both of these by the way to slide back but of course also the article talking about live OS and the rest of port and finally there was a new book release recently called Hands-On concurrency with rust a link to a blog post talking about what it was like to write the book and pointing you to course the new book release and that's it for this week thanks

  
 and so much for listening and as always keep on resting
