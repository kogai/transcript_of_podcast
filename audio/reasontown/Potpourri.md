  
hello everybody and welcome to reason Town episode 11 we're getting into the double digits now and today we're calling this episode paprika's got a lot of stuff not one central theme of things to talk about but before we talk about anything we want to let you know that we are hosting is sponsored by Tyler McGinnis. Com a delinear course based approach to learning web Technologies mean go there and learn about react and all kinds of web stuff thank you Tyler we really appreciate it also sponsored by the company I work for day one I love and you can look up more about they want on the app store for iOS or just on Google did you want to plug Khan Academy Jerry while you're here so I work for Khan Academy online learning nonprofit and they're great to I'll make a plate for you too cuz you guys just released an app for kids education

  
unlimited for my four year old and she loves it

  
 what is amazing that is I don't even know how that works for the money cuz that you do get paid right like lots of big philanthropy donations and then some corporate partnership at some point like you could get enough donations to make some amount of money off of like interest rate in the bank and maybe like probably not enough to perfect you right though about doing an endowment like I mean Harvard has an endowment that is just like billions of dollars such that they can live off the interest that would be cool to have a cool so if anyone if there's an angel and down and our alright so let's get to the news section we got a lot of news today. I'm excited about this the state of Reason survey just

  
 Just Got Started end of last week and we have almost 300 responded so far I will be going for another couple of weeks if you haven't seen it please take it even if you haven't started using reason yet we would love to get your input on what why why you haven't started using it what you like about it what you don't and what we can do to both make language better and the community that are more inclusive and yeah so I kind of wondered for a while what the reason is behind doing these state of X surveys but it seems that it really helps the people who are making a language to better suit the needs of the people who are those are targeting right so that's one reason there's a question about what things would you like to hear on the reason Town podcast so we can we can use that to kind of figure out what are up so should be about there's a there's a question but would you like to see at a reason conference so kind of

  
 choosing how to best meet the needs of of the user base perfect so go take that that survey even if you don't use reason we want to know from you like like you're the saying why go go ahead the response of that survey and tell us why you're not using reason nerve you know what the challenges are so that's great that's super next up is the buckles good 4.0 release from 3x to 400 so the interesting thing here is that the major new version here is a built-in hot related development server for the front end so if you're doing and getting many people doing front end I'm probably one of the weirdos doing not front end as much with this but but that's cool because they had the kind of mock that Noah's module loader the watch the file system if I recompile happens I'll trigger reload in the browser is all without webpack the idea that get up and running quickly get a developing quickly you'll still need webpack to ship because they're not pretending to be

  
 I don't act like you're not going to build any compile bassett's or do any splitting or any bundling for you but it's there for getting started which is cool steve the hello world story was so get my script also you'll need webpack and here's the website config and it just gets rid of that extra step is optionals are more efficient and make more sense so if if there's a nun in your code it shows up as a no interest in your compiled JavaScript and if there's a some with a with a value in it then in JavaScript it's just the value heat you don't have to like get the first element of the ray or anywhere things like that right there that's because if you look at your pal output for your coat before 4.0 then it none was a zero-sum was an array with one element of the valley that I had to get rid of all right so that's cool

  
 way to go thank you about the script people for doing that we really appreciate it and lots of hard work there and this is a company to also I just had the best that's is accompanied by a reason 3.3.2 or 2.3.3 now release so we got some new syntax they change the fast pipe from vertical bar. Fastpipe being like the like the pizza like the right pizza and vertical bar with the right arrow you know use for taking everything I left and putting into the right to change that from I'm sorry fastpipe is the opposite takes everything on the left and put it in the first argument of the function of the right to the fastpipe send taxes change from vertical bar. To the horizontal bar too skinny are oh yeah and it's to be called with no white space around it so it's so it looks almost like an attribute look up from PHP or from

  
 see maybe and so it's it it kind of makes it feel like you're almost doing a big oriented you know in in JavaScript you have object x. Y. Z calling us functions and stuff and now in in recent that there's a similar look to it which is nice for mental flow and I forgot to write it in the notes but actually wrote a blogpost on this was good thanks for reading it that's all I'll put that in the show next to it so if you're still not straight I'm over talking about there's some more information there and then there's a reason reactants in this release some better error messages and other important but but less noticeable changes fixing various formatting bugs making reformat preserve more white space do nice things like that

  
 so thanks thanks to the team for shipping that out too we really appreciate it now we got a couple of cool announcements couple Cool Tools sketch. Sh sketch. Sh released by koe and I'm not going to try to say your last name, because I don't know how to pronounce it but this is a cool tool that's in in browser Rebel for reason but it's but it's not like bucklescript taking the top level the rebel that comes with a camel and putting it on the web and JavaScript and he just recently added the Okemos in tech support as well rapid development of the past couple weeks very cool project that you should definitely keep an eye on especially if you just want to do one off things you know that there's a reason playground but this is more in the spirit of

  
 and IPython notebook or or one of those things where you can have you know some text and then some code and then evaluated in line and then keep it rating on that AC can contributions and help me out I haven't used to the whole time yet because I do a lot I don't do a lot of stuff that doesn't involve bucklescript but where would you find this useful without the need for back. Just enjoying pure reason thing definitely trying one off things it also does the shareable URL thing so if if you're helping somebody out in the Discord Channel and you want to show them all this is how you would do it you can just link to that that kind of thing to you full access to the type system full access to the building data structures Beldum guessing his part of buckles group so you wouldn't have that I don't know if it ships with belt that's a good question because they they have made belt native compatible okay as well so I might be there but that I'm guessing you

  
 super sweet thank you, for doing that and now the other pic is rebuilt the the Cossack folks who are very big in the react native World they run reactive. You and do Consulting for 4 react native development and it's been a ton of contribution to reactive itself and lots of they've been helping get more insight into how reactive is change all these kind of things about reason and so they made a new binding library for reason and react native. It's different than BS reactivated which is the one that has existed before and they're experimenting on how can we make a wreck in the development really really chive with reason I'm so definitely take a look at that the reason way

  
 very cool thanks folks that's our news we're sorry if you did see if you do something cool we didn't and we didn't pick it we apologize you can focus on Twitter that was on Discord and say anymore we talked about my thing

  
 and so let's get to the let's get to the Potpourri skip to the good smelling stuff of the podcast I want you to tell me about this lisp that I saw you talking about on Twitter so one of those what are the things that actually was talked about in the early days of reason why wouldn't it be cool if

  
 anyone could have their own custom syntax that they used to develop reason to develop and reason and it kind of makes sense if you're starting with a language you're writing a new syntax and you know everybody has opinions about syntax so what if what if we could make it flexible enough that anyone could bring their own syntax and it would all compiled down to the same code and somehow the interoperable and there are there lots of little

  
 logistical things to work out with how do editors work and how to build tools work and all that stuff but it's it's a thing that is kind of been been talked about on and off and a couple years ago I wanted to make a a Swifty syntax and I was interested in grammar generator to power generators and so I wrote a thing and then just about a month ago somebody was like I wish I had a list for version of Reason you know I really like closure or I really like, less or racket whoever is but reason of the cool you know a cool project wouldn't it be awesome to have a lisp syntax and Sean Grove who is was really a Santa Clara scripting enclosure for for a while and it's been bugging me about this key thing that's what it was like hey what when are you going to get this done and so I decided to just

  
 kind of bang it out and see how far I got and so I managed to get a working parts are going that covers nearly all of the syntax of reason and I made an example product in it and because I was working on an editor plug in the same time I was able to just kind of make make that work too so you got all the syntax highlighting benefits and you know I prefer type and that is insane to tell a few questions about this because I thought reason was a syntax is this also just an alternative syntaxin capitulo camel or is this a syntax on top of reason on top of Ocala are all the same underlying things with a sibling to reason and it wouldn't you wouldn't even have to call at reason right right does it use anything reason specific it's

  
 nice for bucklescript minute it uses the Buckle script will change until I I call it reason list because you know that the reason Community is the one that is interested in Alternatives in taxes were okay so this is like dislike reasons sibling language uses the same tools for going to jail but this is not reason but okay well that's really interesting so why did you have to write a parser because the backend is the thing with the pluggable right wow and you just like this is just something you just did quick so I had done the hard work a couple years ago when I made a parser generator that basically you can just write out the grammar of all I want I want an open for rent and then I want if and then any expression and I'll tell you what an expression looks like and hear the different ways that

  
 expression can be shaped and so I did that and it's a most of the work was done and I just had to like make a lisp grammar and and do some tweaking thank you he's as to why you wrote your own price of generator wear it because I was looking to do this while back to you and there are a number of kind of academic level existing pressure generators you just pisses an exercise you wanted to do on your own or what this this is Carmen of the weeds but together we're getting the weeds today quite popular ones for oak camo reason actually use as many or which is a a person generator for a camel and they do what is called that they have

  
 it is not non-deterministic but when when there's for example expression and there are seven different ways things like the expression there could be a restraining order there could be a function call or there could be you know several other things look at the grammar says I will check all of these at once and then if there are two that could work I will randomly pick one that's interesting okay and so when you're dropping grammar you have to be very careful not to get these ambiguities and and sometimes I can be really annoying to

  
 to have some out and it make them work until I wanted a person generator that was just you check the first option if it doesn't work you check the second one and on and on and on and it's using using the pack rat

  
 parser format or algorithm which is somebody would pay for in call a pack rat okay and yeah so so that was one reason I also wanted it to be written in reason and I wanted the departure generated code to be reasons that I could edit it better in it if you're going to use my near your writing oh camel and it's hard for me to read a camel they go and you know I want to take advantage of TPX Transformers Ratchet to find the grammar so that you get all the cynics highlighting all the you know I D E features while you're developing the grammar

  
 I got money or has it its own custom file format that doesn't really work with with other plugins and I had made a partial generator for python back in college because I was taking a class about something I wanted to redo it and reason see if I can get a lot faster and that kind of thing I was interested in using it they could contact you and get it by other people

  
 yeah I put some effort into writing up documentation and that kind of thing so if you're interested in making new grammer's if you want to make a reason that looks like C sharp yeah maybe you could do that and now I'm curious about this because I do wonder do you think that it will try with the community to have people doing all these different grammars all the time currently the the barrier is high enough that I don't think I mean it's it's it's not a straightforward thing necessarily it you have to kind of I mean I tried to make reason lisp relatively easy to use but I had to make it into the BS code plug in to be like I I will now recognize a. R e l have an extension and I think if we were going to go all in and say yeah we can have a ton of different grammer's coexisting we would need a more a better solution maybe all of them on disk would look like

  
 you know standard reason but then in your editor it would be the same text that Sherry had to be interesting person to have like at like the main problem for learning that I see is the documentation and stuff because we already had this problem Mike I'll go to look at the guts of a library this isn't documentation obviously but I'll go to look at the got to the library next to it in okay I'm like a much harder time understanding what's going on at the recent attack so I'm so like I'm curious to know like now what if some people pick up reason list now I have three send taxes to try to price when I'm looking through I guess it's just the cost to have an ecosystem that's flexible like that and there's there's reason tools which is a Chrome extension that will you can just select any Oak Hammock code on a page and say turn this in a reason for me and I'll do it which is cool and so maybe if we had a bunch of hits in taxes there be a way to say these are the ones that exist I don't know

  
 it certainly you know not going to be happening anytime soon but some of them think about the idea with the reason list business kind of just like a play thing or do you think are you expecting people to hit list lovers to go and start using it and if it is would you support it and wants to start using it then you take over a new project alongside your at your y combinator startup that you're doing cuz you have time right

  
 awesome letting us about the list for a move on you have some more learnings about server-side reason to Riverside Express is pretty cool the bindings for Express on in Reasoner pretty sweet but here's what I'm doing so I'm not going to go through the whole decision process cuz I don't even know if what we were talking about before on the podcast but I am writing a service that is going to be heavily database based pricing for storing data checking to see if it's change from client etcetera and my plan was to move to post Rises as a day to store and I had done a bunch of writing Sequel and reason to interface with post cries and expose apis and then one day I was doing some more research and looking at like well maybe I could use a more stylish framework like

  
 back-to-back is pretty neat as a new version coming out and it's built on top of Express it's kind of the Rails model where you generate your models and if there is a bunch of code for you like you you would declaratively basically like this what my model looks like and it generates full credit for you guys for it and database model save me some time because my new service that we have designed the new sync Services pretty simple is pretty straightforward and then I'm I'm riding facades of our old more complex API service please. Sounds like it would be great to save some time and write that get that that code that's credits that's generated Bowl taking care of a very cool tool I talked about Prisma before on here prisoner lets you take your graphql apis and Generator back end which is really sweet

  
 here's another tool that goes the opposite way which lets you take your backend and expose your back and as a graphic ulap I called post-grad file which is funny to say but has Rafael just developed by one guy he's been a consultant for post-grads for years and this job is prescribed for years and sells it on the side so it is it is free if you are using it in development and then he accepts donations but if you're going to use it as a bit company years it's expected yeah I think I'm fat as it's actually a plug-in that he sells so it's like if you want these more premium features and gold pay $100 a month but it also says like also just support the project which makes sense like if you're making money with it you should help support it if you wanted to continue to exist

  
 so here's the thing I was like oh yeah these things are always cool but like what if it just supports like the the most basic happy case and doesn't do all of the things I needed to do if I started to press on it this is awesome so I'm a fan of like using postgres to its full extent extensive not abstract. Abstracting over your data base with an RM where you say like well what if I if I want to switch from post-credits to my sequel I just want to be able to you know change the url and have it work which is the idea of some or am I haven't ever heard if that if anyone is ever successfully done because a lot of things tend to be leaky I think a lot of people want to use the advantage of the database itself so that's this kind of Embraces that it says use your database to its full extent and here's what's really neat so this post grad school

  
 the texture schema exposes all of the appropriate graphql types for reads like for your table you like okay I've got to say about a journals table that exposes the journal object for reading then it also does the mutations does a different type for the mutations and then it also detects your relationship between the table and hooks up all of the graph relations and then at the application layer so so this post profile tool you can use it directly as an Express middleware just play right as you got a graph API and you can use database comments on tables and Fields to hide things and disallow certain actions from your API when someone's inserting a record I can say they can insert they can't insert the ID they can't make up their own ID I need to make that for them right so that I can hide that but usually even cooler you can just use row level security

  
 pretty in postgres directly to take care of all of your like user protection and multi-tenancy stuff so like I've got a bunch of people who have Journal data and I don't want any of them to be able to see each other's Journal data and previously and in are the servers we would have to have an application to your logic that would when you send in a request it would check your user and then if it would say are you trying to access the journal okay make sure that the journals you retrieved only belongs to you run post-grads has a has this functionality built-in where now when I connect to the database I send along I actually set the user ID on the session and there's row level rules that I've written under the tables that say only the user who owns the state I can access it and so to those requests that where that user ID is set on the query no data

  
 exist in the database except for the date of the belongs to them and that's that. The database level so that's way faster than the round trip from the application to the database and then post profile also it takes your post your graphql query and it compiles it to one giant sequel statement so there's one round trip to the device I'm pretty stoked about this like this is super cool so the role of a security rules are they written in JavaScript where they how do you get there some special syntax there's a whole lot of like application logic you can do you can you find functions in postgres that you can find functions that run like in reaction to a table changing you can divide fractions to sit there and using post profile you can actually expose those functions as we take tomorrow till like one example they gave his if you want to have a user sign-up you actually write the you write the function for hashing the user's password and storing it in the right places and

  
 making multiple records you write that all as a post-grad function then you expose that function as a mutation that says create user or just super cool and then post supports multiple languages so there is this visit built-in one called plpgsql which is what I used to because it's just like the default in its Sequel and it's hard to read but I want to learn simple better anyway you can run JavaScript there is no somebody wrote an extension that lets you write JavaScript and evaluate it they run some DM and then self evaluate the color I have yet to look into that deeper cuz I don't know like what apis you have access to sure that's what I'd be interested to know but send text wise you can JavaScript it is also built and I believe is python that's what you can do. I have already used the functions that run in reaction to did updating to help

  
 like faster application logic wear if if like a user update their entry in Mark's their journalism being updated to this isn't any reason I apologize but this is like a huge part of the server thanks and here's what my reason code has now become now I have that middle where it says address to lapi so now my reason code is actually just translating the old style API request into new style API request so I know exactly which is cool but I was running into some limitations because that's kind of built for that's kind of built for like when you are crafting stuff by hand yeah client so in this case I am because I'm taking requests that are coming in in like I'm parsing them and I'm getting their their questions out but like

  
 there was a whole lot of there were times when I wanted to just say like pass in this entire object as a actually that was the main problem so four variables in the Dracula TPX they want you to pass in JavaScript object jst of a type they give you a tight that's right because they want it to be well time yet but if you're trying to do a generic like we're just translating some query that could be any number of things that won't work with the yeah specific typing sign in this case I I do actually have typed that map up but I've written Jason decoders from the API that's coming in to decode into the correct date of shape and then I'm just going to plug that in so I am losing a little type safety I just started using another Library that's a basic graphql client where is like you send you send this text string and you substitute materials like

  
 very simple client but it's nice because I have my Jason decoders that construct the fragments that I want from the API that's coming in and I just drop them right in as JavaScript as like a Json object has serialized I dropped that right in since the request off that's great so I I do lose a little bit of type safety cuz I have to make sure that I have decoded that the right way and it's possible that I made a mistake and it feels run time but I'm pretty happy with this right now this is a pretty great Arrangement so so posterizes doing my heavy lifting for me and then my AP I just sit in front of time using Express and I didn't even get to this yet but I actually wanted to talk for a second about

  
 coming up with a reason like apis for existing libraries because it's the express

  
 wrapping Library does a good job of wrapping Express with its current but that wasn't the here's the main problem I have with that I wanted to have an experience where when I'm defending in point I could say before I reach the endpoint I want to listen to Keith the user and I want to get their user object with their wealth to well typed user object in scope and I want to also be able to just throw in another line in there that says by the way also part of the body has Jason and use this decoder and I wanted to be able to hear more complex I don't want to just throw an error if I can't decode the body the way I want and I also don't want to just throw in the air like an exception if the user isn't available or is wrong I want to return meaningful status codes so what do you end up having is middleware but Inn Express when you have Middle where you can't

  
 you can attach stuff to the to the request context but there's no typing there it's just it's just the wild west so you can't like having middleware go ahead and get the user and then attach the user to the contacts and then have a type of contacts that's just and there's no provision for that either in the current wrapping for the Express store earlier than just a plain rapping right and that's where that's where we're headed so it is interesting to think that sometimes it's okay to come up with a new layer to structure the way you're interacting with the library so so I wrote a new layer on top of BS Express that allows you to change handlers and these Handler's carry a context with them so I wrote a Handler that checks to see if the user is there and the thing that that handle it returns isn't just Middle where it's like it returns

  
 okay type Union that says either continue on to the next middleware on to the next Handler and pass this information along or return of the status code so this allows me this is kind of like a try to request specific so it any specific Handler you can say get in the request context do some stuff I need to continue or respond right here okay now I can kind of chain these along so I've got a Handler and then I wrote another one that's another function that takes a a person for the body goes ahead and prices the body and if it doesn't match up at returns at 400 says sorry this the body and formatted correctly and then these are changeable such that they Handler takes in the data from the previous one in line and adds new data to it and then pass it along so that that was hard to say I'm sorry that didn't make any sense just listening but the point I'm trying to make is like for a reason code we can definitely

  
 take the liberty of expanding on with already there and making some new pattern that makes sense for making making it easier and and lover types to do that cuz I think coming from the jobs report on many of us or just kind of like what does use what's there like I'll just use express the expressway in and do all the other parts of a hand cuz it's all this time I could have done by hand without this extra design pattern but it would have been less understandable and more work I think all on the way the downside is the source code for the for that Handler stuff that I wrote is pretty hard to understand so it's one of those libraries like when you see it in you see that's nice but when you go to look at the actual pipes you're like wow what happened here you know this is so hard to understand and I've seen I had that experience and now I'm there some the libraries that are really nice to use but the types

  
 pictures are just not comprehensible but not sure how to solve that it is this is this is complexity that would be just kind of splatter throughout your code and you you group it all up into one file that you can you know right good test for and you know look over carefully but then you don't have to think about it when you're using it in other place that's a great point so you think that's okay as long as you can get the API learnable enough to write down the things that are hard and just in point

  
 well that's the update from my service no actually hold on I got where I got way off in the weeds there but deployment started applying code on elastic Beanstalk with a W and if you remember last episode I talked about deployment being a nightmare cuz you have to bundle with webpack and it said I said her well actually in case you weren't listening last episode the issue was you had to be done with webpack because the compiler being included in the modules was too big for your normal deploy but I started deploying stuff on elastic Beanstalk and using AWS code build which is really pretty straightforward to get setup to build the code before I ship it in and realize that I think I can take my back out completely because I just pushed my repository and Cody will be in chart and they have big big boxes cuz it'll be in charge of falling down the gate code it can cash the install of BS platform so it's already there does NetSpend

  
 downloading it it can compile all of my code there and then build the zip that it's in straight over to elastic elastic-beanstalk because a lot of things like will take as at 5 so it actually does all the build stuff excludes the big kempot like I'll just go ahead and exclude the big binary files that are unnecessary and I can ship all the artifacts that are necessary over with the zip file so there's there's a nice way to deploy I haven't done it yet but I plan to you so you should document that when you got a great idea so if you are wanting to do server side note and book scripts there's a way to do it without having to use my pack awesome

  
 proof that was good so wet when you're talking about post the post and all the cool things now that the way to tie reasoning is to get reason as the language that you're right in the postgres rules at that would be way cool that's probably way more in the weeds then there would be helpful at all that a major Yak shave tonight released the new vs code plugin for reason reason language server I've been making a new ID editor integration that that speaks the language server protocol that loss of editors are using these days and the

  
 the big go with it was no extra things to install previously you had to have Merlin installed separately through reasons and that could be difficult sometimes so one one package to install and Windows support out of the box and so you just you get the reason - Bas code plug-in on vs code and it will work Windows Linux Mac run out of the box no problem are there some bugs I'm fixing them now if you find bugs let me know there's there's get Hub repository where you can file issues and especially if you want to contribute and make it better I've already had a bunch of computers starting in and I've highlighted issues that are good for people that are just getting started I'd be happy to hold your hand to tell fix those

  
 awesome and I installed it tonight thanks for releasing it can be more helpful than the existing Ocala tools right yeah so it it has Windows support out of the box and it it doesn't require any any extra set up that you already said those things but I mean as far as features wear like cut introspection nearly all the same features there are there are some that the one has the other other than having vice versa but I've been using it for the past several weeks as my exclusive ID play Mine by Michael how many hours do you think you spent developing the slang language silver slots

  
 probably

  
 100 no 50 something like that that's good that's good to hear because I think that when people listening hear about projects like these we only here at the end like hey I did this thing and it's typing what I should be able to pop out stuff like that too but it's good to hear that that it took you a whole lot of work to get her released because then we get a better perspective for yeah but I wouldn't even this project was building on a couple of the products that I've been working on for the past year and so I was able to reuse a lot of the knowledge and some of the code from from previous things that we're doing code introspection in that kind of thing cool awesome so did you are there other people that are joining an innocent like

  
 as opposed to maintenance plan for this cuz I don't know that you're going to have a hundred hours more to keep emergency order quest in reviewing stuff I mean so I pick up the people that are fixing bugs and make changes I think that in not too much more time it will be at a place where it doesn't have to change very much okay right it'll it'll just work when there's a new maybe when there's a new bucklescript release it'll be a couple more features or a couple of changes that I'll have to adapt to but I think they're the bulk of the work is actually done that you're saying so I'm curious about people who who make plug-ins for money and I don't think that it doesn't sound like that would be telling it's interesting to you but like jetbrains sells their IDs and they do a great job of making like massive

  
 power for couldn't respect and refactoring cuz I wonder like if someone approached you and said hey I would like to take your plug-in and at all these paid features on to it and and like take it over to maintain it and make this free version the papers and what would your response to them be

  
 that's that's a cool idea that they're definitely a lot of I've had a lot of ideas for cool refactoring things that you could do that they would take a lot of work and pull off and I might get some of them but you know debt definitely as long as the decor remains open source and so there remains a free version I wouldn't be opposed to somebody saying I mean I really put a lot of effort into the ra Factor experience and make that awesome thing I wonder at what point like I wonder how big the community you have to get before that would be profitable for somebody to do right with your question

  
 be glad to pick it up cool stuff that's super exciting I see one more thing on her list that's right so we we've gotten a bunch of responses to the the state of Reason survey and one of the biggest things that people are excited about is Let's Get Medicated syntax so I can do async-await so I don't have to keep nesting promises and I'm doing all the stuff and we're finally getting an a single Voice and text and this isn't just a PPX right this will be a first class Citizen and for those of you that like category Theory it is a generalized monad syntax so it'll it'll be you can use it for options and results and promises and you know if you're doing LWT a sink you can use it for that but it's it's basically way to to have the same as async-await in JavaScript instead of

  
 promises it'll all be in line and it's a new way to declare a let variable where you're saying you know let a sink x equals y and actually bound to the result of why once it's been resolved so let me let's get in the weeds warning for anyone is listening just go ahead and Skip if you're not a weak person but if I'm guessing I'll be listening you're probably okay with weeds cuz it's kind of but do you have to Define like what the app how would you for example say okay now I'm working with it an option like using it on implements

  
 right now it is it's more General than monat interesting ly Sunday so you there are some interesting things that you could let guard using this for Zoey if you view Swift or Russ there's there's a way to do an early return and you could Implement early return using the syntax basically all its if you're familiar with continuation passing style wear instead of having local scope the way to declare a variable is to call you no make a new function and then call it with the value and then the perimeter of the function is your new variable so if so anything where you you know can pass a value to a function and then a call back to the function that will get called somehow

  
 can use it with the syntax in a white sew with with option if you're like I have all these options for example if I'm doing graphql and they're like it optional things and I'm you know I'm getting into call back hell or do like you know the arrow pattern you can

  
 having an option module that says okay when you do let I'm going to do a switch on the value and if it's none of his return none otherwise I'll call the Callback function with the contents of the adoption or anything so they just have to be a special

  
 like function available on the module that you're using so we we haven't specified any built-in modules yet syntax I see and so you can make a module that will do option you can do it make module that you promised and then we'll probably bacon to belt or somewhere here are the most common that we found in the scope or is this kind of an implicit thing where the the syntax looks for the compatible function and calls it for you so if you do let. A sink x equals y it'll look for a book called a sink

  
 if you do let. A module call they sink or module call a sink that has a let underscore function in it and I'll call the little call async. Let us know as soon as you let. Uppercase I think so okay so like if I made it function if I made a module called who just pulled that one out of the air and I have some kind of continuation passing pattern in here I would say let. Foo

  
 and then it said a few I would make a Define a function called let underscore and that would take it would take a value and function in the case of promise if you let that promise or would it be let. Jazz. Promise something or like that... Promise so I can do that. Oh wait and it looks like jobs for permit

  
 I see I see what you're saying yeah I didn't like for an option I do let underscore equals promise. Then okay and there's an an underscore because if you're defending multiple things for example that the promise. All you could do that. Away tax equals y +. Wait Z equals a all right and so then you can do a promise or all in it and have them both concurrently my mind just blew up oh okay that's where the the monad that's the monad

  
 I forgot what the the name of the operation is but but joining two things together so what if you have like a list of promises and you want to do promise that all and all of them would you do you promise all on my list I don't think there's any benefit for having a syntax that would break apart your list or do weird things like that well but if you if you waited at you would just return it whenever the list of results right so what you could do is you could make a module called like a weight all or something and it takes my list right Alyssa promises it's just a generic wow that's really interesting

  
 so when do we expect to see it

  
 you know it'll it'll probably get murdered in the next little while and then the next season release will will have it okay so I mean like always always thinking like oh yeah yeah maybe we can probably get this in the next 8 months how often does it take more than a couple more weeks to wow and then they will be this. Of time where we look like to use this we were careful in the proposal to make it as minimal A change is possible cuz there are some things like well what if we would be nice to actually have a lowercase oh wait it's it's weird to do lap. Capital a weight and later on we could say yeah we'll add that sugar to Auto capitalize the model name or you know what if it gets annoying to keep typing out is there a way to do a local open and just have that automatically apply to all lapsed like that there are a couple of different ideas where what

  
 we start using the syntax we might say okay here are the things that are annoying so what about how do you feel about the balance between language complexity and verbosity here cuz like

  
 I saw was a cool language but there's a whole lot of sugar and it's pretty rough when you're just coming into the language arguably that's a front load cost and so once I learn tonight at 7 to call I was fine and I can understand it after but certainly coming into skull I was like there are so many cases worth like if you just have no idea when you can leave this off and if you want to just do this you can leave that often leave this in there and it's just like how do I even read this stuff like that kind of the opposite approach where it's like we didn't there's no sugar this is just brand you know like reasons in the middle right now I kind of did my own Sugar by using Haskell Ash operators for promise that's been okay and I'm excited for the syntax but I'm also wondering do you think it's anything like, kids the language

  
 it comes from seeing people using Haskell's operators and I think this will be easier to understand okay because you know there's a lot of weight and you can come and click a wait and I'll take you to the module definition and you can see exactly what happened so I think this is actually less magic than than what people are forced to do currently and I like that about it to make it more readable to and also async-await is a pattern that a bunch of other languages have already implemented and had lots of success with I'm in so I think looking to that and saying okay this is this is a standard practice thing that has me all these languages better let's do that

  
 and then oh yeah I was going to ask you about are handling this is going to be the same I mean and you can implement this for any data type you want including trizor results results of the PX in my reason language server so I was like okay what is it look like to to do this kind of transform I'm not with a specialist in text for it but just with this you know a s t plug in and it's made everything so much more and you know when when people come into to try on contribute to the code the places where I've started using that it's easy to understand the place where I'm still using the Haskell like in fix operate like I don't even know what's going on I have K I make sense yeah I'm excited I can't wait to see that come out

  
 okay well that's that's our last thing I think that's a wrap unless there's anything else please go out if you haven't yet fill out the the state of recent survey would love to get your feedback on the community and language and everything else I don't remember if I normally half an hour but if they are then you just got a double dose because an hour episode and that's time to go to bed will be getting some more interviews on here in the next little bit so look forward to that and see you next time thanks everybody by
