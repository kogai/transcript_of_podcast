  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly rust and Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode for October 18th 2017 kicking things off this week is there rust 1.21 release so the big news in this release which is near and dear to my heart is this is the first release that has the are less that's the Russ language server ID support and stable so before it required that you had the nightly compiler or you to install the nightly compiler with rust stop and now this is the first time when you install it that you can get the are less as part of their the stable release now to get this package will want to install the RLS - preview so they are less isn't quite one. Oh yeah it's still a preview but you can at least try that preview in the stable

  
so this next news item actually called me a bit by surprise I'm sure too many programmers like myself the name O'Reilly stirs up some warm fuzzy feelings O'Reilly tweeted this week the O'Reilly Rust book that's coming out shortly is now the most popular book on Safari I'm shocked and flabbergasted I think that's incredible to see that much support for the new book that's coming out here soon what other bit of rust news so get Hub has really if there are Octobers it's kind of their state of the union that they do once a year in this year's October's GitHub showed that rust is in the top 10 most reviewed and most discuss project

  
what other tiny bit of rust progress news so I've been following module count so this is a website that looks across languages and shows for each language how many packages are being created in that language has slowly but steadily increase the speed at which new projects are being added nowadays between 15 and 18 new packages are out of the crate Sido everyday that's that's amazing that's some pretty serious progress so we just passed RC Ran So This is the our package manager buttars a statistical programming language of pretty popular statistical programming language and we're just about to pass the package package count for Haskell in the next couple of days so these are extremely encouraging numbers to see not to try to compare us the other languages per se but just to get a sense for how well rust

  
growing this weekend Servo news so this week the servo team lighted support for the jet stream Benchmark there about 5 benchmarks have been selected to track performance over time of the servo web engine and the jet stream Benchmark is the one focusing on JavaScript performance it's really encouraging to see each of these major benchmarks land so we can watch service performance increase going forward

  
 and that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and keep on resting
