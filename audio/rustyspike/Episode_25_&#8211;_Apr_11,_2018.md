  
hello and welcome to the Rusty spike your weekly Rustin Servo News podcast I'm your host Jonathan Turner and this is episode 25 April 11th 2018 wow it's been a little while it's been a few weeks since we had one of these so let's get started our first news item this week is rust reach is now starting its second year that's right in 2018 we're having another Crestridge Crestridge is a is an Outreach a mentoring program that serves under-represented people and technology so people apply and when they apply their skills will be the match with a mentor on the Rough Side so they learn a bit of rust the skills they have will complement those of the mentor and from that a project blue pour it out over the next couple months last year is extremely successful the application process I think they had over 300 applicants I'm expecting big things for this year

  
our next news item is about all hands a little over a week ago a week of Russ planning and creativity wrapped up in Berlin over 50 people from the various sub-teams and rust got together and did a bunch of planning towards the rust 2018 Edition bunch of the sub teams got together and plan what needs to happen for the addition and what needs to happen over the next 6 to 12 months there's a ton I cannot even begin to cover how much stuff got covered in those in that week but I'll link in the show notes to Aaron torons right out of all the things that happened in that League all the decisions all the ideas that came out of it of course just like always these decisions aren't finding decisions the big one still of course will become rlc's but this was a very productive very much a lot of creative juices are flowing and that really shows

  
so couple of news items in the rust and webassembly space the first one is webassembly. Studio if you haven't check this out definitely check it out if that's the assembly. Studio to tap it into your browser you'll be gifted with a very cool preview of some of the technology that's being worked on powered by the same technology that does visual studio code allows you to open up project and create a new webassembly application you can use see or rust or type in the web assembly by hand or use a grind number of other language so it's very cool to see what you can do already and I'm excited to see where this thing will go next

  
another bit of webassembly news so if you've done webassembly in the past with Rusty may have noticed that it actually is a bit of a pain to interact between webassembly and a JavaScript of the larger web ecosystem there's now a tool called wasm find Jen this is another tool for the tool box at working and webassembly this allows you to more easily in a route between the web assembly code the JavaScript code and the rest code a link to an article that talks about that round-tripping and how it's made a lot easier with these new tools it's come up a few times in this podcast that async-await is steadily making progress without votes has posted the next in the series and this one I think does a good job of capturing just how close the current design is to being ready in the article they linked to to RC's that are part of this effort the first one is the async await design itself and the second one standardizes some of the Futures work so this is

  
this is some of the work that's already been going on Tokyo in the Futures library and the standard library for the first time. Of course link to that article so you can read that and then check out the corresponding RFC and our last news item is about making things a lot faster this is pretty cool so gstreamer is a multimedia framework especially popular in the Lenox community been experimenting with moving parts of their coat over to the rust style of things so the recent blog posts they were talking about how much they were able to decrease CPU usage by switching to the rust base approach or talking 65 to 75% it's almost too much to be believed to be honest with you but I'll go ahead and Link the blog posts in the show notes so you can read it for yourself and find out more

  
and that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and as always keep on resting
